    "To collect all the needed training data, I need to use mostly of the same methods I used to get the sample data. But instead of getting all the reviews from one game, I need a wide variety of games. I start by getting every App ID on Steam, over 115,000. I then grab the first 100 reviews labeled \"most helpful\". Many games had no reviews, or less than 100, especially when only taking english reviews into account. I end up with 2,132,897 reviews for this dataset."

    "The initial dataset for this project used games taken from the \"hot\" section of Steam, and had a 80-20 class imbalance. This data, taken from all Steam apps, has a 75-25 class imbalance. Popular games are more likely to have more reviews, and also have more DLC, which counts as its own app for review purposes. This imbalance might be improved by only counting games, and by taking less reviews per game. However, that would end up with significantly less data overall, so I have decided not to go there for now.\n",

There are also storefronts, such as itch.io or GOG that cater to different types of games than Steam or Metacritic, and so might help the model's ability to generalize.\n",
