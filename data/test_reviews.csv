"While it does feel like they needed a bit more time to work on it, it definitely delivers on 90% of the things we believed it would. Give the game a little time to patch some of the bugs and fix the performance issues so many are having and we have another CdProjekt Gem. If you don't want to play a massive game at launch because of the issues it may have then so be it but you are definitely missing out if you don't. 
Was it worth the wait? I dare say it definitely was.",True
"Game is asbolutely good. The Night City is something different and very well designed. Graphics are spectacular. Having a solid 60 fps with 5700 xt on 1080p with most options ultra/high. Most people that complain for crashes, either they haven't updated their drivers or they have messed up with OC settings on gpu/cpu. Your system has to be solid stable, since the game is demanding. I've been messing up with some OC myself both on CPU/GPU and the game kept crashing.
Use always DDU when updating your drivers. Most times solves problems like these.
I haven't encountered any major bug until now. Only some floating mobiles but reloading the game these disappear.
For sure the game needs work and some time to fix the bugs, but I'm pretty sure most of them will be resolved.",True
This game has a JoJo reference.,True
"Cheers everyone, after 8 years we finally made it! Before I get started, please make sure to fully update both your game and subsequently your drivers before you make any complaints. Thus far, in the sheer 4 hours of pleasure I've gotten out of this game, I have not had any immediate problems whatsoever and I only encountered one bug, which was in the mission ""The Pickup"" where I was asked to talk to Jackie but I could not enter the building cause a soldier kept blocking me, which a quick save load fixed. Other than that the only other noticeable thing was the random FPS drops which I did not mind.

To close out this review, I would strongly recommend this game, but at least for the time being, only if you have a very decent/good PC, because even I struggle to max out the game with my rig which has a RTX 2070 Super and Ryzen 7 3700x, with that being said, enjoy the game, and thanks for reading my review.",True

"First of all, the game is fun, decent, at first it gets a moment to ignore all the glitches and bugs but it is good. You start slow but end up having a lot of things you can play around with.

But it has a lot of problems around it.

What makes the game a little bit unfun mostly is:

1): The way they set a recommended hardware and now, me having even more than the recommended, it runs poorly and looks like trash.

2): Stealth its buggy and when you try to do stealth kills on npc that are not enemies police automatically spots you and goes after you.

3): While you drive npc will freak out and run away screaming as if the AI never saw a car before.

4): The Mission and Call menus are really bad, when you try to change a mission you have to pause the game and look trough the missions mannualy, Borderlands 3 got this solver by sorting trough missions with [ and ].

"i'm not gonna recommend this game for the time being. Yeah sure i'm having fun but the game's a buggy mess and it can and will be a buzz kill in some otherwise nice moments.

[Update 1 | Version 1.04]
More playtime, more frustrating bugs. But in roughly 70 hours playtime i only clipped through the map twice while exploring (was rather funny) and the game also crashed twice. I can say that the only thing that keeps me invested is the story and side quests. Another thing of note is that the commercials and trailers put the wool in front of your eyes. Mostly Character & Gun customization and Side Activity wise. Cars are also a massive dissapointment. You can have 3 varients of the same car but can't recolor any of them. So if you wanna have a open world game with proper gun, character and car customization. GTA V will suffice.

[list]
[*] [b]-[/b] A ton of minor bugs and glitches (none gamebreaking)
[*] [b]-[/b] Barely any Role-Playing Elements
[*] [b]-[/b] Choices dont matter

Can it live up to the near mythical hype that it had surrounding it? Well no, not even close.
Look, it's not a bad game per say, if you take it as an action adventure it's actually pretty decent. (aside from how buggy it is)
But if you're expecting an RPG, or all of those features that were promised in early showcases, you're going to be sorely disappointed.
This is an action adventure, not an RPG - Sure you can create a character and go for different skills, but that's pretty much the extent of roleplaying you're getting here.
You barely ever get to make any choices, and if you do they barely ever matter.
As a straight male you have a single romance option and once again, this can also only play out one way.
Despite Street Cred being supposed to present ""natural progression"" and how your character becomes more famous and well known, any sense of natural progression is lost here.
The most progression takes place during a minute long montage.
Also screw the fact that you cant even ignore phone calls.

At the moment it is still buggy as hell. We're talking invisible weapons, questobjectives not updating, floating objects, people falling through the floor and the collision detection in regards to movement is waaay too sensitive. (You can get knocked out of stealth or literally flung into the air by running over a small box on the ground).
Thankfully so far, all of these have been fixable by reloading. Seriously, quicksave often - on that note, I can't understand why they didnt add a quickload function.

Basically, the gameplay is fun, the story is on rails but enjoyable enough but it's not a smooth experience at the current time.
In a year or two and when modders get their hands on it, this is probably gonna be a really great game.

I recommend getting it on a sale, if you can handle a rough experience and dont expect an actual RPG.

CDPR should've just given it another year or more. Shame.",True
"I mean, I'm enjoying the hell out of it. I don't care what others think.",True
Fun game but highly unstable. Save often,False
"I can't recommend a product that needs more work. I understand 2020 hasn't been easy for game development but this is still unacceptable for a full priced product. The bugs I've experienced is something I'd expect from Ubisoft, not CDPR. 

Floating objects, characters clipping into the ground, some quests breaking because no dialogue prompt showed up, car got stuck in a dumpster, and audio doesn't play at certain times. The combat music will sometimes keep playing after defeating all the enemies and the AI is completely abysmal. 

I'm driving down a street, about to see a guy get executed, and then the shooter freaked out, starting shaking insanely into the ground shooting everywhere, and then at the end of the animation it went to normal... I had story related car chases where the enemies stopped shooting and were just staring at me.

The writing is solid enough and the story is very interesting. The game looks stunning, and the world is amazing to gaze at. Sound design is great (when it works), and the music is great too. 
But then you realize how artificial the world feels. The combat is underwhelming and the melee feels very sloppy. 
The world looks so pretty, but its lifeless once you look closer. Unfinished or unrefined systems that shows the game needed more time to be worked on. 

Truthfully, this game will objectively be better months from now, and mods will elevate the game experience. However the core issues don't seem like things that can be changed with patches.

I cannot recommend it at the moment sadly. I might keep playing, but I should honestly stop for now.",False
"this review is spoiler free

Mm, cyberpunk 2077, the beautiful overhyped game that many people are unclear about what it is, is it an RPG? is it an action adventure game?

Let me say this, if you are looking for an open world sandbox game, this game pretty much fails at that, the most open world you might get out of this game is looking around the city while driving and listening to radio, and the most interactive you might get is going to a gun store to buy some ammo, that is, until you finally engage with the crafting system and then the gun stores become almost useless considering this game is a looter shooter at most, you might go to a ripperdoc or 2 at times

But if you're looking for a more linear game to do quests in, complete objectives, invest in character development and progress through the story, the game does pretty well at it, there is plenty of content and side content to engage with, you get new missions over time, while a lot of side missions might seem like your typical ""steal this, kill this, recover this"", the level variation does help with making them more unique, and the different approaches you can take, like stealth, ranged or melee, the story missions usually are the big ones, with a lot of content packed in them, including cutscenes, lots of dialogue, and characters that will stay with you thru the story

THE GAMEPLAY

the gameplay of cyberpunk 2077 consists of melee, shooting, driving, stealth and general exploration

The melee can feel both satisfying and dull at times, slicing people with a katana sure does feel great, but the melee for me lacks feedback, at times i am in a combat with 2 people and i cant tell if one or another has hit me because there barely is any feedback

The gunplay is pretty good, to me at least, there are your typical looter shooter mechanics like elemental damage tho it doesn't matter too much, fire is OP though on humans, but most you should care for is the DPS, the guns themselves feel nice, the animation, the sounds, even to the little details like different animations depending whether there's a round in a barrel or not, the animations feel snappy and tactile, and the shooting is nice, most guns handle well too

The driving, i only played with a keyboard but its pretty slippery and too responsive, and also tends to bug out a lot when crashing into something, the AI drivers are dumb,  they tend to stop for no reason, and the way the city is structured, you cant really go off road much, there are barely any parking spots either, so you are left to just park the car on the road itself and it will generate traffic jams and the AI does nothing which breaks the immersion, the car models and interiors are pretty nice, the dashboards are animated though usually just show the speed, i'd suggest you just use the bikes instead of cars, just because they are smaller and easier to get around with, the car damage is minimal so usually you dont have to worry about trashing your car

The stealth is your basic ""dont get into the enemies line of sight and dont get detected by cameras"" it serves is purpose and is pretty basic, you can hack certain things to distract or damage enemies, you can hack the cameras, breach the system to make it more vulnerable, and you can grab, subdue or kill enemies and hide their bodies in dumpsters

The general exploration of this game mostly consists of looting and finding shards with text in them, you can find various crafting components, weapons, outfits and ofc, shards there is also your basic things you can find like grenades and health

There are 2 types of leveling systems in the game, regular and street cred, normal level lets you upgrade your typical categories like body, intelligence and technical etc. street cred mostly lets you buy or use new things, and every category has its own perks

The crafting system is pretty easy to understand, you find components and click on the thing you want to craft, some perks let you access new things to craft or you find more things to craft around the game world

and now, lets not forget
the bugs

The game is buggy, like, really buggy, i cant spend 30 minutes without seeing an animation glitch or a car phase thru objects, the AI is dumb and dont get me started with that joke of a police system, the open world AI in general is just underdeveloped, most pedestrians just walk back and forth while the cars just drive randomly until they stop or crash for whatever reason

i am yet to encounter a game breaking bug but i had a lot of annoying bugs like at one point one sound got stuck and i had to restart the game, or i was driving my bike as it just slipped under a car and went crazy until it blew up

the performance is questionable too, i am running close to minimum spec (GTX1060, Ryzen 5 1600), and i am getting around 40FPS on medium settings, i dont mind it though but a lot of people want that 60FPS, i've heard people on RTX cards had a lot of performance issues too

"I don't like giving this game a thumbs down but the current state is not acceptable. The constant bugs/glitches and the terrible optimization takes out the immersion from this beautiful world. NPCs are lacking they just despawn/respawn soon as you turn the camera, COPS AI is terrible they spawn in massive groups out of nowhere and there's zero consequences for committing crimes. The story is great the side characters are great but that's all i really find enjoyable but even that's hard find enjoyable when u get 25fps. Coming from The Witcher 3 this game really seems like a downgrade it simply needed more time in the oven. In a few months I hope they fix the issues and this game can be what everyone wanted.

"Really annoyed that CDPR is using awful console performance to paper over fundamental problems with the game. I don't care if it ""reviewed well on PC"", after 50 hours I have no desire to play this game again because after the 10 hour on rails intro missions the game world devolves rapidly. I think if many positive reviews posted at 10 or 20 hours were reconsidered, they would be on the fence or give this a thumbs down.

It's pretty to look at...and that's it. Any attempts to interact will be met with bugs, of course, but also shallow systems and AI that's so bad comparing it to other games is funny, but pointless. Of course the industry figured out how to simulate police chases and realistic NPC routines etc almost 20 years ago, but the bizarre popping in and out of existence for NPCs (including cops) is just baffling. It only makes sense when you realize they actually did this on purpose, because a fully developed AI would simply break the game. Even monster PCs can't avoid random 30% frame drops because the limited NPCs in the game are already too taxing.

I don't think this can be fixed No Man's Sky style. They are just going to have to completely re-release the game in a couple years because the engine is legit broken. CDPR, stop saying the PC version is okay, take your crappy ""roadmap"" and actually fill it with details, and be honest about whether this game can actually be fixed at any point in the future.",False

"[h1][b]Cyberpunk 2077: haunting and epic but laughably unfinished[/b][/h1]

[h1] TLDR: 8.4/10 [/h1]

[/list] 
[h2] Preface for the in depth Review[/h2]

Cyberpunk 2077 was among the most highly anticipated games in history. Its brought to us by the same developers of the Witcher games which, in addition to the casting of Keanu ""Breathtaking"" Reeves, is probably what made this game as hyped as it was. With all this hype this game was destined to be a failure for some, for me however it was probably the best gaming experience I have had all year. Despite the amazing writing it is just average in some of its ""RPG"" parts, this did not hinder my enjoyment much, but it might lower yours significantly. 

[h1][b] Story and Characters [/b][/h1]

[h1] Main Story [/h1]

Cyberpunk's Main story (around 25 hours) is relatively short, especially when looking at the Witcher 3 with its around 50 hours. The biggest weak point of the story is the first act. It mostly just serves as setup for the main story and introduction to the world, this is also where your chosen live path only ever plays a major role, which is somewhat disappointing. After this pretty generic 3-4 hour long introduction the story jumps to its high point and stays there for its entire run, it's an incredible story where you as V get to decide how it plays out. Once starting the second act you will stay at the edge of your seat throughout the entire journey. The ending is an emotional banger, and it does not really matter what ending you get, V's fate is always a punch in the gut, always fitting with the classic themes of the Cyberpunk Genre and the World of Night City. 

[h1] Side Stories [/h1]

Through the side Quests you really see the CDPR magic doing work, they are across the board very thought through, witty and always interesting. If you read this right now and have yet to play/finish this game, go play through the side missions even if they seem meaningless at first most develop into mind-boggling stories that show what kind of bleak future for the human race is prophesied here. The side quests always end with though moral choices, they give you a better understanding of Night City and how  AI ""lives"" in it in Delemain's quest line or ""Coin Operated Boy"" for example. Or they give you a disturbing glance at Night City's politics in ""Dream on"". 

Those often surprising developments lead me to always do every side quest. You never know if the basic ""kill x"" side quest you just started develops into the best quest of the game. There is also some foreshadowing in some side quests, adding greatly to the replayability of the game.

The Side quests also majorly influence the endings you can achieve, doing some side quests will open up 5 more possible endings. You are free to rush, only playing the main story, but also can experience the game in its entirety and get something totally different as a ending. 

[h1] Characters [/h1]

The Characters are the heart of the game. The story is great and raises interesting points regarding AI, our possible future and body modification, but the characters in this grim world are what makes the ending so emotional especially with what happens while the credits roll.

However, V, is the in my opinion worst written one. The 3 live paths did introduce you to him but never really gave huge insights to any bits of his past. Every other character is believable, and you get to know them greatly, from goals, past to personal struggles you get to know everything about the people living in and around Night City. 

The Characters of Cyberpunk 2077 are more than you might expect at first glance, the most prominent example here is clearly the man, the myth, the legend Johnny Silverhand. He is also the character most prominent throughout the story and the one that undergoes the most surprising but amazing development. The others are not much different though, they all are so well fleshed out that once that ending hits, it really hits hard. 

[h1][b] Gameplay and Sound [/b][/h1]

[h1] Combat with balancing issues [/h1]
Its all up to you how to approach a mission, you can just run and gun, hack the enemy into killing himself or bring out your blades from inside your arms. Across the board everything here is pretty average and not groundbreaking in any way, the game is clearly not about the combat and more about the story, the amount of variety however does make up for it. A huge problem for the combat is that the different aspects are not that well-balanced in my opinion.
Melee and Hacking/Stealth feels way too strong. Another problem is that missions turn from hard to very easy in no time at all and even turning the difficulty to the highest level does not make them more challenging. 

[h1] Leveling up [/h1]

They handled the role-playing features very well in my opinion. There are attributes and perks. Attributes are here more major while perks are more specific. The Attribute points are sparse, and you can't get all maxed out. That further increases the replay value since you can't get your Attribute points back. Always trying different builds will be one of the main reasons to replay this game.

[h1] Sound [/h1]

The pretty average gunplay gets compensated here. The Gun sounds are what makes the combat fun pair that with the banger that is this games soundtrack, and you will have fun just shooting up some cyberpsychos. 
The Voice acting is also top-notch.

[h1] The AI and Physics[/h1]
Both are just bad. Nothing more to say,  surely a downgrade from games that came out a couple of years ago. 

[h1][b] The World: Night City [/b][/h1]

[h1] Open World: Atmospheric but not the next GTA [/h1] 
CDPR's worlds were always about stories and not about you interacting a lot with it. What you experience in this game you experience in the quests, not in any side activities. There is not much interaction with the world. Its mostly a stage for the characters to play on. You have an apartment, but it does not feel like ""home"" because you just can't do anything with it. Just don't go in it expecting it to be a Rockstar game, because it is not. 
However, the atmosphere in Night City is amazing, driving through the rain as never been better in any game i have ever played. Its also very detailed. By looking around, you know in which district you are, what people live here and how. 

[h1] Visuals [/h1]
Its stunningly beautiful. My old GPU really surprised me with how good games can still look with it. The Photo mode also is a great addition to really capture the beauty of Night City. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2331607167
Its not well optimized though, it does run relatively smooth but dips below 40 fps at times. Even on moderate settings. 

[h1] Technical Problems [/h1]

It seems the ones i had were relatively mild but still decreasing the enjoyment to some little extend.Especially when i had to reload just because i got stuck with a quest which happened at least 3-4 times.  Technically speaking its clearly a mess, but the same was Witcher 3 and look how that turned out! 

[h1][b] Wrapping it up [/b][/h1]
With Cyberpunk 2077 CDPR cements itself as the best game studio for story driven open world games, yes its unfinished, yes games that came out more than 7 years ago have better physics. Yet, similarly to The Witcher 3 those problems do not make the game less powerful and the themes it tackles not less meaningful. CDPR made the, in my humble opinion, best game of the year and one that with further work could manage to be remembered as one of the best period.",True

My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined!!,False
"Having spent 100+ hours in this game, completing basically everything except very niche achievements, I can say with confidence that you should wait to play this game. Of course, that doesn't mean that it's awful all around. As I'm sure others have said, the game has great parts to it: the customization, the roleplaying, the story; there are plenty of things that make this game great. 
At times, you can be immersed in the game to the point that you don't realize that you've missed lunch, dinner, and your midnight due date for your research paper before you said you'd do after playing Cyberpunk for another hour. The characters and environments you interact with are some of the best thought-out elements of the game. Main supporting cast characters like Judy, Panam, River, and Johnny are some of the most interesting video game characters I have had the pleasure of leading through their story arcs. Night City itself is a character - with crazy conspiracy theorists, gang members, corporate thugs, semi-sentient/automated machines, and normal people just trying to make it through the everyday struggle that is NC. While you can go out of your way to find side content between story missions, sometimes they'll find you while you're just wandering through the labyrinthine streets of the city instead, and bring you down a rabbit hole of new content you didn't realize the game had.
On the other side, the game is great at pulling you out of these immersive moments. Bugs are everywhere in this game, from minor ones - teleporting/vanishing/reappearing pedestrians or cars in the distance - to things like - you can't shoot your best gun because you put a scope on it for god-knows-why prevents you from pulling the trigger and you die because of it, losing 15 minutes of progress - type of bugs. Other notable bugs that I've experienced that have absolutely obliterated immersion were; a vehicle important to the plot suddenly flipping itself upside down so I couldn't progress because it wouldn't unflip, so I had to redo a good 30 minutes of a mission; an equipped quickhack ability that actually makes enemies immortal even if you don't use it ever; an optional stealth route through a pretty major mission that doesn't work at all and forces you to go through combat sections instead. And these are bugs that come just from the top of my head. 
The game is clearly unfinished and unpolished, with some shining moments throughout it. If you think things like I mentioned above aren't deal breakers, then go ahead, buy the game; you'll enjoy it. Otherwise, please wait. There are wonderful game systems, mechanics, and story elements buried under layers of bugs and unpolished muck, but it won't be worth it if you're bothered by them. Hopefully CDPR doesn't get tanked by law suits so bad that they can't finish the game.

"Playing on RTX 2080 i9-9980HK 2.40GHz, 32G ram and . . .This game is a hot mess.  There are so many bugs and glitches that absolutely break the immersion at every turn.  The very first mission when playing as a Nomad had 3 major bugs.  Just trying to drive to Night City proved tough because there were floating people in the road that popped in right as you drive over them, causing the police to spawn instantly standing on your car then I fell through the map.  The second time I was almost to Night City and then all the sudden there were floating drivers in invisible cars that I couldn't help but run over because they just appeared, all 20 of them floating, not in cars.  So when I ran into them, the police cars warped in,  piling up on top of mine and glitched my car upside down which is unrecoverable.  On top of the endless bugs the game lacks simple basic features for PC.  You can't walk, it is either run/sprint everywhere which results in running ahead of NPC's then waiting, running ahead, then waiting.  There is no toggle ADS nor aim sensitivity.  So you have to hold down Right Click and the sensitivity is soooooo slow that I have to drag my mouse off the pad like 3 times to turn 3 feet.  You can't change any of these settings.  You can't key map most things.  These are such simple basic features for a PC game that has guns in it.  I wanted so badly to love this game, but I can't even hold my nose and get through even the first part of the game.  Floating people,  glitching through map, and mission breaking flaws are super prevalent.  The stealth at least in the begging is very weird.  If you stand directly 5 feet in front of a bad guy he wont see you, unless you stand there for 5 seconds.  It just feels so broken in every respect except the graphics.  The graphics are really great until you start running around or doing anything it starts popping in and out and glitching out.

bugs break missions

Most are half-arsed memes or not even actually mentioning how bad the bugs and glitches are, all that really matters is the updoots and minute of fame rather than actually point out the flaws of this title; I'd compare it to New Vegas on launch which was a fricken mess.

The only positive i can think of is that the game at times is genuinely gorgeous. Night City does feel amazing to look at and explore which is awesome when NPCs aren't phasing in and out of existence or even T-posing.

The Negatives however DAMN THERES A LOT. From uninspiring gunplay, crouch = stealth, the character customization not even being as detailed as it marketed and the ""RPG"" mechanics being more limited than Fallout 4; The game markets itself and prides itself as an ""RPG"" but the perks and upgrades are mostly just percentage increases rather than unique perks and skills or gameplay mechanics to spice things up. The driving is somehow worse than Ubisoft driving which is a freaking achievement in itself.

With the deceptive marketing, Hype and positivity, this game will no doubt be a major success. Which I find amusing as if this was released by someone like Ubisoft it would be mixed on Steam; But no, most people are ignoring the bad because ""works fine for me. it have Keanu Chungus, It made by Witcher 3 dev so must be good"".

REGARDLESS. It's not all doom and gloom. As mentioned i compared it to New Vegas which was horrible on launch, but it got tweaked overtime to a playable state, which I'm hoping CDPR do as I do want to experience and enjoy what this game has to offer.

But as it stands, this game is about as good as frozen pre-packaged spaghetti, it being not very good or tasteful compared to the real thing but consumable if you can stomach it.",False

"My faith in the video games industry is gone because of this game.

After watching crowbcat's recent documentary on this game, it's shown me just how bad the whole situation with Cyberpunk 2077 actually is. The problems with this game is more than just bugs and glitches, it is the false promises, cut content, lack of details, choices that affect little to nothing in the game's linear story and while the storytelling is one of the games few strong points despite linearity, it isn't enough anymore for me to want to complete it.

Cyberpunk 2077 was the game that I personally wanted from CDPR. I didn't care too much for Witcher 3 because of my biases and lack of interest for the medieval fantasy genre, but I have to admit: that was more of an RPG than Cyberpunk ever was.

This game is fundamentally broken and the only way to fix it would be to redevelop it from scratch. To make it into a true RPG experience akin to Deus Ex, Mass effect, etc. As of now, I can no longer trust CDPR. They were supposed to be the example of what a good video game publisher is and be the defining leader of the video games industry, but no matter how good intentions are anyone can easily fall just as CDPR has.

Nobody in the AAA industry can be trusted anymore. No matter how many good promises they have. The only language in the games industry isn't words, it's actions. And CDPR is going to need a LOT of actions to redeem themselves.",False

Good to see ya. I've got to talk to you about something. 
CD PROJEKT RED, CYBERPUNK 2077.
A while back, the guys from CD Projekt RED approached me and asked me to be apart of their new project- Cyberpunk 2077.
They were going on and on about how they'd create this vast open world with a branching story line. How you'd be able to customise your character through in-game choices and it's not something I knew before but I was excited by. 
I'm always drawn to a fascinating story.
Cyberpunk is set in a metropolis of the future where body modification has become an obsession. You play as an outlaw and enhanced mercenary, working in the sleazy underbelly of this city. Yeah!
Okay, let me tell you. The feeling of walking the streets of the future is really going to be breathtaking.

"As a lover of the Fallout Series, I am more than use to bugs and graphical glitches.  Yes! You can tell its missing pieces that were at one time planned, with all that said it's a great story, with tons of amazing beauty that I got 90 hours of fun out of.  Any time I spend $60 and get 90 hours of enjoyable game time it's a good purchase for me, especially with single player games. Just chill in Night City and take a walk around, you never know what you might find.

Bad:
1. Unoptimised, had to restart game to get back to normal fps

This game was overhyped in my opinion but its a must play for any cd projekt fan because they have totally made night city a living breathing world in which you can lose yourself.

Don't speednrun it, you just'll kill the experience for yourself you ADHD ridden weirdos.

Immerse yourself in Night City and be goddamn happy with it. A day one patch will come sooner or later. I myself am personally loving the hell out of the complex and engaging world CDPR has given us.

"While I wasn't entirely sure what to expect when I bought this game, as I wasn't drip feeding the marketing material into my veins for 5 years and raising my expectations, I was picking up on the vibe people were having about this game. It was going to be an RPG where you could ""be whatever you wanted to be"" in this fantastic Night City. Well the city is beautiful, but it's like playing an interactive movie. You cant change your character once you make them....so what was the point of customizing them? you can make eddies but the only thing they are good for is buying new hardware, which doesn't change your body nearly as much as you would assume from all the marketing of everyone having these jacked up cyborg parts. your parts give you  one of two things: more numbers for damage, or more numbers for time. neither of them are that appealing. You see some NPCs, especially these cyberpsychos, all tricked out in chrome, and when you look at yourself you have tonka toy arms that hardly change their functionality. 

The AI is...sad. My impression was, these nomads (my lifepath choice) go around blasting people in their souped up rally cars and trucks to survive. Well, sad to say there is no driving AI in this game. What that means is, there are no car chases, no bike chases, no vehicle chase of any kind that is not 100% scripted. What is scripted, is pretty janky and mediocre. Speaking of bike chases, you are literally the only person in Night City who knows how to ride a motorcycle. Well, except for 1 character but again, its ALL scripted and that character doesn't spend too much time on that motorcycle before it becomes yours. The police are there to make sure you conform to the intent of the developers and nothing else. They are metaphorical walls that prevent you from doing any crime in the city that is not scripted crime by the devs. Shoot someone, 1 star, means police will teleport to your location, shoot another (or run a few people over) and for each hit you gain 1 star. at 4 stars you will INSTANTLY die from dozens of supercops teleporting to your position to make sure you don't step out of line. It's not totally game breaking though, because if you walk 20 feet away (somehow) they will forget why they came in the first place and return to their pocket dimension. 

Before I go on and on about the poor gameplay design choices, the erratic behaviour of all the scripted material (which is the only stuff worth doing) and the sheer pointlessness of ""life"" in the city, I'm going to cut myself short and say this game was never going to meet everyone's expectations, but it failed on more levels than it succeeded for me and I wasn't entirely sure what I was getting with this game. I have finished the game and the story is... good, it's very good, but for me this is a one and done. There was no point to the open world, they should have just focused their attention on the stuff they wanted you to see and leave all the fluff on the chopping block because none of it really works very well and so the attention to gameplay like hacking and shooting and basic enemy AI suffers. 7 out of 10 and mostly on having a well done story, not worth an 80$ movie but hey that's what I get for not doing my research.

UPDATE ok so all the issues got fixed and this game runs great the only problem I have with it now is that i'll start playing the game and then 12 hours will go by and i'm like what the heck that felt like 10 minutes",True
"After nearly 200 hours of gameplay, I can say this is among the most enjoyable games that I have played. I am nowhere near finished playing either. 

The most notable in this game is the story. Cyberpunk 2077 feels more like a movie with a video game inside, when doing the main story. The brilliant writing, voice acting, soundtrack and more, makes this game among one of my all time favorite games. The options and branching of the story is also enjoyable, as well as background specific quests, that build depth to how the story fits the unique background and choices. 

For the obvious, the graphics are fantastic. The game looks amazing and the presentation and environment is very visually appealing. I can drive around the city and enjoy the presentation, or run around into the more narrow areas, and appreciate the many extremely detailed areas that this game has to offer. In all, the city keeps showing me new things that I have not yet seen.

The controls are phenomenal, except when it comes to driving. This game definitely benefits from the controller when behind the wheel. I also feel that the melee combat is a bit lacking, and feels to be button mashing when all is said and done. However, the sneaking and firearms are extremely enjoyable. I enjoy doing missions without ever being detected, using the cyber skills and ranged weapons, or sneaking behind the enemy and putting them into a choke hold. Cyberpunk makes covert play very enjoyable. 

The driving on the keyboard is very lacking, as it is a balance of tapping and gauging how much or little your vehicle will steer. I am sure this will be altered or adjusted in time, but I am getting better at it. I find myself sometimes just unable to avoid slamming into the poor bystanders on the sidewalk, just staring in horror at my ping pong style of driving. 

My biggest complaint is how much of this highly detailed world seems to be locked and unavailable. So many doors are locked, but I take hope that the fact they show locked with an interaction is a sign this will not always be this way. I am also hopeful for more interactions with the environment, such as arcades. I spent many hours playing Gwent in Witcher 3, the arcade games in FO4, and so forth with the mini-games. 

My second complaint is the police, whom seem to be terrible annoying. Many times, I wish there was an option to turn them off, and is the only reason I am not playing on the hardest difficulty. There are times that I cross their view in narrow passages, and they attack me for simply passing by, such as the path up and down from the apartment of V. I am hopeful that this changes as well. 

My third complaint is the number of times that I skip dialogue, because I am trying to stand up. I play the game sneaking most of the missions, and find myself skipping initial conversations, needing to reload to see what I missed. 

Cyberpunk 2077 runs far smoother and with far less problems than my initial experience with FO4, but comes with its own unique issues. Regardless, this game is amazing and definitely worth the experience. Even with my complaints, this game is a 10/10 for me in value and enjoyment.",True

"Some of my takes after 60+ hours of this game on PC as a non-fps player:

Cyberpunk 2077 is beautiful graphically in it's own right, from the grungy night city to the sunny dust-filled badlands. You can tell the developers and creatives behind this game put immense effort in ensuring the game environments are visually immersive and thriving. Put a set of headphones on as you explore the city, listening to sounds and you feel like you are right there front and centre. Looking at Night City is a feast. 

Yet, interaction with the city is bland and disappointing. NPCs on the street have nothing to say to you aside from 'Is that a problem?/ 'What are you looking at'? Others might consider you a nuisance and attack if you accidentally stumble too close. 50% of the buildings and entrances are locked or inaccessible - whether this was meant for more of display aspect or something that still needs to be fixed I wouldn't know. 

AI Intelligence in Police is also low and has surprised me in comparison to other bounty systems in other games. Hit some pedestrians by car? That's okay - once you accelerate to the next street, the police will forget it happened and you are safe to come back. Your crimes are not remembered and the city doesn't really change based on your decisions, as previous promotional material makes it out to be.

Stealth is something that they introduce from the beginning of the game and is often encouraged in some quests. However I felt it was badly executed as AI can spot you relatively easily and it is much easier to just run in guns blazing altogether. 

Plot-wise and the storyline, it is well written, unique and you do become invested in your own character as well as others. However, you can tell that STREETKID is clearly canon because regardless of which life path you choose you will end up in the same progression one way or another. This goes the same for love interests, where female LIs have a better backstory and content than their male counterparts.

While I do love my V to bits, their (depending on the gender you choose) personality is very much set in stone and your dialogue choices doesn't really have an affect on how the playthrough goes aside from romance options and choosing the final ending of the game. The illusion of choice is there but it fails to come true as expected.",False
"[h1] Here is my essay nobody is going to read. [/h1]

Night City, and surroundings, is a beautiful high detailed map with copy pasted assets, cars on rails and NPC’s that have less character than a headcrab. If you are going into this game expecting the world will have more activities and life to it than any Rockstar game, you’ll be disappointed. But if you look past all these shortcomings you can easily be immersed in this big and open world. Well, if you’re not being interrupted by the endless phone calls you get in this game that is. 

Gameplay is mediocre at best. The gameplay has never wowed me throughout my playthrough. Everything from quickhacking, stealth and gunplay has been done before and is not ground-breaking. So Bioware will make up for this right? Modifying your body with cybersteroids and not needing guns was something I thought was going to make this game stand out, boy was I wrong. In the game’s opening you’ll meet up with your doc and he decks you out with some fresh optics and a hand implant. And that’s it. You can buy more Cyberware but this just feels like an extension of the skill tree. Buy some reinforced bones for more carrying capacity... [i] zzZZZzzzz [/i], hey wake up! You have review to read. 

Driving: worse than GTA III. 

Brain dances: don’t get your hopes up. 

Decision making was something new for me having not played many RPG’s before. And it’s still new to me now. I thought I had a bad relationship with the guy in my head, I was wrong. I thought I locked in my ending halfway through the story, I was wrong (More on this later). The only real “decisions” that will have an impact are the romance routes. Pick the right choices (there are guides) and you’ll get more gameplay, and an erotic scene less lewd than a GTA strip club! Don’t pick the right choices and, well... Choom you fucked up. 

Bugs: yes! Many? A few to many. Ruin the game? Not really. 

Difficulty: Distributed your main skills evenly until max level? You now God V. 

[b] SPOILER ALERT [/b], kinda. 

[spoiler] And now the story. The first parts were great, lots of character building and explanation about the guy in your brain. You will reach a point of no return, basically the final mission, this is what I thought was the weakest link in the entire game. Most decisions you’ve made mean nothing and you will be greeted by (3*2)+2 possible endings. After that you will get one of those endings and be dumped right back in front of the point of no return and the world acts like nothing happened. The side missions however are great they, sometimes, are more detailed than the main quests and you SHOULD play these before the point of no return. [/spoiler]

"Such a beautiful game. Fantastic voice acting, memorable and lovable characters that you enjoy coming across through many cleverly designed missions, innovative choices present for character building, a fascinating soundtrack, an enjoyable combat system, a spectacular city that you will find yourself constantly staring throughout your adventures... All these elements come together in a way that you can sense that this unique journey has the signature of CD Projekt embedded to its core, which made me fall in love with Witcher 3 in the past.

The technical issues present at launch and the few disappointing in-game mechanics such as lackluster AI did not keep me from absolutely adoring this game. Even though I agree that criticizing the FPS problems and abundant bugs is completely fine, people seem to completely miss the fact that Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the most ambitious games of all time unlike their favourite ""buttery smooth"" game franchises that release the same product over and over each year with little to no innovation whatsoever. Apparently I was being way too optimistic to expect people to express their sensible critiques rather than getting involved in a witch hunt alongside a bunch of kids who didn't even try out the game.

TL;DR: Cyberpunk 2077 is an exceptionally ambitious game that promises you an unique and memorable experience that I absolutely adored from the beginning to the end. However, waiting for the new patches to be released for a while is probably the best idea for someone who hasn't bought the game yet.",True
masterpiece despite the circumstances,True
"This is the first review I’ve ever written. So no I do not recommend this game.
My PC is high specs so that is not the issues I’m having. 

Where it went wrong: for most of its development (8/9 years) it was advertised as an open world RPG. The marketing team hyped up about how big of an RPG it’ll be and it’ll be the best ever. Then 1 year before release they subtly changed it from rpg to “open world action adventure”. Which misled some consumers as there was no reason for people to keep checking if it’s an RPG and it doesn’t help that steam has it tagged as one on the storepage,
They did not time manage well (possibly due to aiming too high) and kept delaying until eventually “feeling pressure” to release an unfinished product. I think they were just greedy and wanted to get in for the Christmas (big shopping) period to make as much money as they can. I can’t imagine how bad it is on console. They didn’t treat their own team well, the game is broken even on PC (numerous glitches and bugs including multiple main quest bugs that require you to reload hours back or completely restart the entire game), the AI is atrocious, the sneaking is actually fun but the terrible AI can counter it (“a body has been found” when there’s only 1 in a dumpster where no one is even near, be careful of the psychic enemies I guess), the side quests are boring, and the main quest doesn’t really pull me in either, you randomly stand when crouching which is a bug that can really screw you over with enemies.
 
I’ve actually known about this game for 6 years, I’ve been waiting that long and still thought it was a RPG until purchase. 
The dick “slider” is funny but it’s just for marketing to sell it to people. The character customisation is alright but a little lacking. The clothes were better off not having armour stats so you aren’t forced to wear the ugliest clothing for best stats, they scrapped so many things including car customisation and apartment customisation which I feel would’ve actually really added to this game despite it’s superficial changes. 
The intro stories don’t really make any difference so I’m not sure why the option is given. 
I do wish that there was an option for a silent protagonist. Like a voice on/off, and more dialogue options instead of a preset personality and the voice of a 30yo female smoker.
The text is SMALL. It’s really difficult to read subtitles and text to read things in this game. It’s ridiculous and there’s nothing in options to make it larger. It makes it more difficult to immerse yourself if you have no idea what anyone’s saying (NPCs) or the text says in the world around you.
You cannot change your character’s appearance (not even hair or nails) after the start of the game in a world where you have cybernetic implants even replacing body parts... The lighting is terrible in the character creation as well. It’s strange.
I don’t know why they didn’t do a colour wheel for the hair. There’s a weird red/blue mix but not even pink? And they are LACKING with skin tones. 

All in all, when they fix the game it’ll be alright. I’d say maybe 7/10..  I hope they fix the game and eventually add in some features they scrapped. I mostly don’t recommend due to the company’s massive failures even to its own staffs treatment and the extreme bugs and glitches that unfortunately can have a large impact in game like the ones I experienced.

I’d describe it as a broken af futuristic GTA but not as good.",False
Bugs but I have had a great experience so far. More of a mixture of Fallout/Farcry rather than the Witcher.,True
"Is it buggy? Fairly, yes.
Is it optimized well? God no.
Is it unplayable? Absolutely not.

The problems with the technical side of the game are overshadowed by the incredible content that IS the game itself. The setting is gorgeous, gritty and sometimes too real. The things that fill this beautiful setting, the jobs, the story, the characters, all come together to make an incredible work of art that, at least to me, is now unmatched in its genre. It RARELY feels repetitive, and almost definitely requires multiple playthroughs to see the game in its entirety. It'll definitely be worth its value in content alone. 

However, like I said at the beginning, it isn't perfect. There are in fact game breaking bugs throughout that will require you to restart save points and play differently in order to progress. They are few and far between in my experience, and can be worked around, but in a ""play it your way"" type of game, that does become an issue. There are also places in Night City that absolutely TANK framerates simply due to the level of detail and the density of the population in those areas (The ""Red-Light"" area of Japan-Town comes to mind). 

Overall, though the game currently has problems on its technical side, the content itself is fantastic. Hopefully CDProjekt will come through with patches and fixes. I would have rather waited another 2 or 3 months for this game to have been more thoroughly tested, but what's done is done, and I definitely see this game going from ""Great"" to ""Immaculate"" once these glaring issues are fixed.",True

"I truly believe Cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece, but not for the reasons you might assume. While the common folk of steam choose to focus on the many bugs and optimization issues that appear throughout the game, they lose track of what Cyberpunk 2077 was truly intended to be. Masked behind the beautiful streets of Night City and the underrated outer lands of Pacifica lies the true meaning of the game.

This game is a social commentary about the dangers of postmodern sleeping. What is this postmodern sleeping, you may ask? Early on in the game, and every subsequent nap, the main character chooses to go to sleep in quite the peculiar, compromising position. Many gamers united across the internet to discuss this, but quickly dismissed it as nothing more than another ""imperfection"" of the game. However, the main character's method of sleeping draws into question the evolutionary change of sleeping positions across the next 50 years and the dangers it may bring to our society. After the release of Cyberpunk 2077 last week, many academics conducted scientific experiments on this sleeping position and concluded it likely will lead to the end of the human race. I won't get into details, but they're totally telling the truth. Let there be no coincidences; the plot of this game is a deep and pertinent warning about the scathing dangers of postmodern sleeping. 

This is why I can only but recommend everyone interact with Cyberpunk 2077, not as a game, but as a work of art, to see for themselves the impending doom that postmodern sleeping poses.",True

Bugs: yes
Police AI: yes a problem

Estou próximo de finalizar a história principal, e em breve jogo novamente, indo em outra carreira, provavelmente em street-kid, jogando em inglês, para notar melhor as diferenças, aproveitando o máximo todas as quests secundárias.
Uma pena que a versão dos consoles está muito cheia de bugs e problemas de performance, resta aguardar que os desenvolvedores otimizem mais o game, para melhor proveito de todos.

"Creating this review being level 11. Graphically and content-wise the game is simply sublime.
The game bears many resemblance to the latest Deus Ex games (Human Revolution / Mankind Divided) but more ambitious and in a huge open-world.

You'll also see the attention to detail every step of the way: dialogues, items, environments, gestures, effects.. all contribute to the immersion of this world. However, in the same manner you'll also encounter numerous minor glitches that will break immersion, at least in current version 1.04: NPCs that float and walk in mid-air, cars that appear from the ground or out of nowhere, the collision detection makes some items explode/fly around when you or npcs touch them, when you try to drop a body while crouching most of the time it also explodes or gets hurt with a pool of blood... i mostly laugh with these bugs but hopefully they fix them in future patches.

I've only encountered one game-breaking bug during the helicopter-turret section where the game didn't detect that I killed all enemies so I just kept flying around in circles forever. Once I reloaded the last checkpoint and repeated the section it worked correctly.

Update after earning 100% achievements with 160-180 hours: Not much to add beyond the above. Unless the problems with this game are really dependent on hardware, I have the feeling that the supposedly ""broken state"" I see commented everywhere on the Internet is being blown way out of proportion.
The game has its fair share of visual glitches sure, but I've had literally 0 crashes with a stable overclock during all these hours and the performance is actually surprisingly good for what I'm seeing on screen and the fps I'm having when compared to other games. However, it's true that there seems to be a leak somewhere and as hours pass playing, my fps get lower. Until patches come out resolving this, I recommend closing and re-opening the game every couple hours.

Going further into the content of the game, I've very much enjoyed the variety in combat, the narrative and the endings. I would've reduced the number of blue NCPD spots and/or side gigs on the map though, as they're all pretty much the same and they end up being a bit tedious if you aim to do all.",True
"under all the bugs, glitches and performance issues hides an amazing game, I wish you discover it's beauty",True
"Needed another delay for about 3 months maybe but in just 3 days of release they made significant progress in stability, just gotta deal with the ugly graphics and rendering til things are smoothed out, stay strong samurais

*Edit*

After 3 playthroughs and a datamine of the game I thought I should include some notes to help whoever reads this on their purchase

Most dialogues (98%) have no impact on the story whatsoever. The vast majority of dialogue only changes the next line of dialogue and that’s it.

Only a very small subset of dialogues (around 2% of all dialogues) actually have any impact whatsoever.

You will always end up on the same linear story path with the same objectives and missions no matter what. Even if you go for the choices in this guide or not won’t change what missions you get. The game is much more linear than it seems.


After discovering these I've changed my review to not recommended, not because it's necessarily a bad game (the writing is very good, the bugs may bring it down a little but CDPR has promised 2 major patches to fix the problems) but because what they promised and what they delivered are two majorly different things. Hope this helps in some way.",False
"In the title Cyberpunk 2077 we can see the number [b]2077[/b].
This is a subtle reference to the fact that the game has 2077 bugs diommerda

On a serious note, do yourself a favour and don't spend 60 euros for an alpha test. 

[h1]PROS[/h1]
The game has a good story telling, character delevopment and cool side missions, but the main attraction is, in my opinion, Night City. The attention to details of the city is just mindblowing.

[h1]CONS[/h1]
The game is clearly rushed and unfinished. For now, i've personally counted 57 unique bugs. Most of them are minor, but some of them are actually game breaking.
The meelee combat system is just embarassing, all the enemies have the same moveset and it has less then 5 moves, and all of them have a flawed hitbox. Armors are either useless (no noticeable difference between 90 and 1800 armors points, unacceptable for an RPG) or bugged, so you will get killed with 1 or 2 hits no matter what you wear. Some of the cyberware don't even work.

It has potential, too bad that the current game state makes the experience frustrating.",False
"As of writing this I'm about 8 hours into the game. Since I can’t return it, I might as well review it, if only for the catharsis.

They're just starting to release bugfixes, so maybe I'll end up enjoying it. I'm hoping it'll eventually make me want to keep playing. 

But right now, the whole thing feels half baked, at best.

It isn't just the bugs. I won't even get into those. A certain level of jank was expected, it comes with the territory. But the myriad bugs pale in comparison to the game's surprising lack of depth and overall poor development.

Cars and pedestrians appear and disappear the moment they hit the general area approaching your screen's edge. A conversation with Jackie at a noodle stand went clear over my head as I sat watching every NPC drop in, walk a few feet, then blink out of existence. Cars on the road are shuffled at random as you change your view; one moment there's a compact behind you, turn around and it's a luxury car, turn around again and it's an old beater. 

There is ZERO AI or pathfinding; cars are pushed along preset paths in the road, and the merest suggestion of an obstacle will prevent them from progressing. If you fire a weapon out on the street, pedestrians will crouch en masse and stay there, unmoving. Until you turn around, of course, at which point they vanish.

These aren't bugs. They're not inadvertent errors. It's poor development.

The ephemeral NPCs habitually populating this superficial world are equally superficial automatons with looped animations. When I first entered V's apartment, I saw a guy pounding on a vending machine. This was just after learning to hack objects, so I figured this was a prompt to practice my hacking skills. Nope! I hacked the machine, it spit out a bunch of cans, and nothing happened. No response, the guy continued pounding on the machine. Later, I came across a purportedly bustling market, lined with food stalls. I walked up to one, hoping to buy something. Nope! The vendor barked a canned response like every other NPC, yelling at me for bothering him.

You cannot interact with the world in any meaningful way. It's a very pretty picture to walk through as you travel between missions. 

""It's a fully fledged RPG, not a shooter with RPG elements,"" said the game's official Twitter account. So far this is as accurate as claiming to possess a “living breathing world.” Sure there are skill trees, and maybe at some point I’ll reach some dialog that isn’t all railroaded with different flavors of “yes.” Even Fallout 4 had more opportunities for role playing (despite becoming the benchmark for lack of choice in dialog). In Fallout 4, you could sit down, grab a bite to eat. You could change your hair, perhaps add some scars to show how your character has progressed over time, convey some sense of the world having affected you.

In Cyberpunk 2077, a world where you can pop out an eyeball for something fancier, upgrade your prefrontal cortex, or 'plug and play' a rocket launcher or sword in your arm, you strangely can't get a nose job. You can't even get a [i]haircut![/i] You can't change your appearance at all, outside of what clothes you wear. 

""A fully fledged RPG"" my shiny metal foot. 

The opportunities for roleplaying that [i]are[/i] in the game are as shallow as everything else. The ""lifepaths"" seem little more than an afterthought. I chose the nomad lifepath, thinking that this made sense from a roleplaying perspective, as both V and I would be experiencing Night City for the first time. I imagined the luminous cityscape growing larger on the horizon as you approach it from the dusty desert... 

Nope! 

After a minutes-long intro mission out in the badlands, consisting of some dialog and an on-rails vehicle shooting segment, the screen fades to black and you're treated to the exact same ""hijinx with Jackie"" montage as the other two lifepaths, fading back in six months later, no longer a stranger to the city.

Any color you like, so long as it’s black.

Lastly, if all the transparent artifice and facade, if all the game-breaking, mission-restarting, progression-ending bugs you'll inevitably encounter have somehow left you with any lingering doubts as to the utter absence of quality management or QA, I recommend my favorite pastime: spotting spelling errors! There's no shortage of them, be it in subtitles, the interface, in-game documents, even world design!

Only problem is the difficulty, I can run through on very hard difficulty without much trouble.

"Played it for 6 hours so far so I will update this as time goes on. My current set up isn't out of this world. It's simply an i7 8th generation CPU, GTX 2080, and 32 gbs of 2666hrz RAM. Nothing like the out of this world set ups I've seen people playing with. The graphics are lovely and stories written within the side quests and main quest are pretty great so far. The meat and potatoes of this review though are the bugs. PERSONALLY, I haven't(knock on wood) encountered any game breaking bugs just yet. The only bugs I've seen have been minor light glitches here and there, frame drops from over population on the screen, and clipping through my own car with a motorcycle I stole from some thugs. That was probably the worse of it. I've noticed one other where my third weapon slot continuously doesn't get saved? Like I'll place something in there, save my game, do something, reload my old save, and everything saved in terms of my set up except for whatever weapon I had assigned to my third slot. It's only EVER the third slot cause it doesn't matter what is saved there, it just disarms itself when you reload. Other than that, my experience, overall, has been pleasant but I can see how the game still requires various levels of polishing and I can't wait til it does encounter a slew of patches. Would I say hold off on getting your copy? Not exactly. If your experience has been anything like mine then you'll enjoy all the amazing aspects of this game but if you notice extreme issues and crashing with it within the first 24 hours, I'd say get your money back and hold off until the first or second round of post release bug fixes go out before making your purchase again. I was super hesitant because of the reviews but I know everyone has different experiences regardless of set ups. There have been those with far more superior systems then mine experience absolutely abysmal performance and crashes so if I was in their shoes, I would 100% instantly ask for a refund and hold off til then. But for now, I'm pleasantly surprised(albeit not shocked that it's still riddled with bugs but thankfully, IN MY EXPERIENCE, haven't been too intense).",True
2077/10,True
"Let's start with stressing the fact that I didn't have the whole Cyberpunk 2077 hype that many people had, therefore I am not extremly disappointed with the result. Still, it doesn't mean that I am anyhow close to being satisfied by my experience with the game so far.

Let's start with the system requirements, supposedly with the system I run the game on (recommended system requirements) the game should be playable on at least medium graphics settings, that surely isn't the case, I play the game on the lowest of the low and I push around 40+ fps with drops beneath 30 fps happening more often than I can bare. Very frustrating considering the fact that I didn't plan on buying the game because I thought my system would be too weak, then I've read that the recommended requirements fully check out with my current setup, well, apparently they don't. It's either a very ugly bait tactic or just very very bad optimization from CDPR.

The game feels very unpolished at the moment and everything just feels very awkward and somehow badly glued together into this abomination that this game at the moment is.

Combat, ah the combat, it feels extremly clunky and every fight is basically the same, aim at the head, spam the left mouse button and wait for them to die, the game outside and inside of combat feels like two different games, the one inside the combat feels like some budget bastard demon child of Call of Duty and Borderlands, taking the worst out of both games, the enemies eat bullets and you just spam until they die.

The AI is extremly bad at doing what they're supposed to do, in many combat situations they will just focus your companion ignoring what you are doing fully, which is allowing you to pick them off easily. Their focus is wrong, their positioning is too and they don't cover themselves properly, they just wait for you to kill them.

Hacking, hacking in combat seems to be useful sometimes but I don't think it's used to it's full potential really and during combat it actually doesn't feel like a necessary part of the combat, another annoying thing are that the enemy hackers can get your gear burning from far away on the map while you have to see the enemies in order to do that, annoying, very annoying. 

Driving is horrible, just horrible, the cars feel heavy and clumsy and I find driving in this game to be just a very boring necessity. Not even mentioning the invisible barriers you hit on the road.

Levelling up and choosing skill points feels very non intuitive and unsatisfying, you really have to study the parameters and think about if you want your 5% armor or maybe 10% shotgun damage, hard for a new player to make a decision about such small parameters, it would be better if the perks and skills actually gave some more impact than just some silly percentages, you don't feel like your character growing or getting stronger at all because of that.

Weapons are just meh, everything waters down to which weapon gives you more DPS and that's what you roll with while selling off all the other junk, was hoping that CDPR would not take that to Cyberpunk from Witcher, but I guess they really felt that would make the game complete, sadly, it didn't. Talking about what that CDPR likes throwing into their games, we once again have items being everywhere to collect. Why you ask? Well, of course we crafting in the game, and I assume you will have to craft items so that you can later after the very next fight loot a stronger item and throw out the crafted item you were collecting trash to create in the first place. Great isn't it? Now throw in the awesome weight system into the mess and the game is complete. Great recipe for forgettable items and weapons, here you go.

Story seems so far to be the best thing about the game and probably the only reason I keep playing it, that and because I bought it for the full price and since I played for more than 2 hours I will not get a refund anyway so I just feel that I have to at least complete the game to make myself feel like it was worth it.

Judging by how unsatisfying and empty many things feel in this game I am surprised that it wasn't made by Bethesda, I actually expected something better from CDPR.

I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone at this moment as it is definitely not worth the 59,99€. I hope they will polish up the game and patch it quickly so it becomes first of playable, stable and then also enjoyable. Looking forward to that and I will definitely change my review once that has been done.

Also, I almost forgot. Dexter DeShawn smokes an uncut cigar, that totally broke my immersion.",False
"It's a great game and very fun to play. But I'm still disappointed as it does not live up to the hype. There's nothing revolutionary or out of this world for a game that took 7 years to come out. I was expecting game tech at least better than RDR2.

There are so many features that were promised but don't exist in the game at all. To compensate for a small map, ""Verticality"" was promised, but the amount of interiors are not impressive. The combat is mediocre. There are issues where quests don't progress after a certain NPC disappears for some reason - often reloading the last save works, but if you decide to do an second quest instead of reloading the last save, the first one remains bugged forever, breaking progression permanently as a few players have experienced. One of the biggest things that break immersion are the AI and the NPC and their extremely generic behaviour, again something that was promised but not delivered. Press F to talk and they repeat the 2 lines in a loop. You go to another NPC and they say the same thing, even with the same voice. Shoot or aim a gun at NPC's and they don't flinch. Kill one and the rest casually mind their own business as if nothing happened. Cops spawn 10 meters away after you commit a crime. Most of the NPCs are copy pasted, including their animations - very evident inside Lizzie's bar. Most of them stand around doing nothing. Compare this to RDR2 where every NPC at least does something - walk around, sit on a bench, read a book or let out a fart - They even respond to you like they're completely context aware. The hardware requirement specifications were also incorrectly announced for this game.

The game by far is still amazing, the story is great and the characters too. The city looks beautiful. The bugs and the performance issues are not game breaking, I'm sure they'll be fixed in time. But the game simply does not look like as it was advertised.",False

"Wait for patches

I can't really recommend the game in its current state. This game as much as I hate to say it, Cyberpunk 2077 should have been delayed again.

The game is incredibly buggy and unoptimized. 

Even with a Ryzen 5600x and RTX 3080 I'm getting drops to 40 FPS with some of the settings lowered and DLSS on.

The AI in the game is a joke and it makes combat and stealth unsatisfiying.

The driving is horrible, it's Watch Dogs 1 levels of bad.

This is inexcusable by CD Projekt Red, this is far worse than Witcher 3 on launch. My game has crashed multiple times, I've had to reload saves over and over because missions keep glitching in progress,

It was a huge red flag that they did not allow reviewers to show footage of the game and only B-Roll footage from CD Projekt Red themselves.

Cyberpunk 2077 is clearly not a finished game with how it is, I'm really let down by this launch.

"Written on: 14/12/2020 (DD/MM/YY)
The main thing that pisses me off is the render. Pre-rendered NPCs and objects looks worse than Metal Gear Solid 1. When the game is rendering in all the textures, you get stuck at everything. Currently played past ACT 1 and doing all the sides now. Sides and GIGs are fun, interesting when u read all the shards and also messages from computer. Sneaky pistol built is OP. Don't expect the driving aspect in the game to be good because these devs never make a game with proper driving mechanics inside and ooh boi, its worse than Ubisoft's Wildlands and Breakpoint. One really sad thing is, certain Unique Weapons can only be obtain in a specific main quest. If you didnt pick up the weapon during the quest, its byebye and that sucks. Either reload a save or replay the game because you progressed too far in the game and realised theres a katana you forget to take. Playing from an SSD, 10700K, 16gb 3600MHz and also RTX 3080.

"[b] So Much Potential, Wasted [/b]

Cyberpunk has the bones to be one of the best RPG's on the market. Honestly, the game mechanics are quite fun, the story is intriguing (although it can be predictable at parts), gunplay feels quite nice, and they have some intriguing characters. My major gripe is the lack of personal touch for V. Ultimately, V plays very similar despite different voice options. He normally has the same line of thought regardless of dialogue. For a more narrative driven game without such a free aspect, I wouldn't knock it for that. However, I would say that for having an open-world and fully editable character in terms of appearance, the lack of difference in V's personality is disappointing. What sealed the deal was the incompetence of the studio who made this. Even on PC, there are so many glitches. It is sad to see how many times my experience has been less than desirable because of bugs. If the game fixed these bugs and gave more freedom, I would say that this could be a contender for game of the year. However, these two major concepts sink it for me.

That being said, I will finish the game regardless. I do enjoy the game. However, I cannot give it a positive rating not just for the missed opportunity, but the errors of the studio behind this game.",False
"After 10 hours, I just can't find anything wrong in storytelling or atmosphere. Sure there's bugs, but its still new.  11/10, would recommend",True
"From a high-end PC perspective and around 34 hours in so far:

Graphics: 10
The game is simply beautiful as a PC player with all the settings including Ray Tracing turned on. The in-game render looks way better than any of the pre-rendered videos they play, and it’s incredibly cinematic when you are on main story parts. Ray traced reflections…are simply amazing. I’ve spent hours driving around the city just looking at stuff. Trying to find places to take screenshots. Just being there. That said, even if you are not on a top-end PC, it’s still beautiful. Look at gameplay footage I posted earlier on the toaster minimum spec…still looks great. My wife plays at 1080p/high on a 5700XT and framerate is high, and visually it is still stunning without ray tracing.

Immersion/Style: 7
I love the cyberpunk genre. Loved blade runner, Akira, all those animes and stuff from that era. Of course I’m an 80s kid, so go figure. The world feels very immersive, with a huge difference between day and night that really brings it alive. It loses some points for a lot of NPCs being too often-repeated, and obviously they’re just generated to make the world feel alive but often falling in that mark since they aren’t actually interactive. Between that and doors that obviously don’t lead to anywhere saying “locked”, there just seems like a bit more interactivity could have been made.

Story: 6
The story is good, but it feels like it’s meant to be played as a Corpo only, with little attention being paid to the other 2 backgrounds in the story. I am playing as a Nomad as a second playthrough (restarted because I goofed my stats) and it feels a lot less connected than when I was Corp. It feels the main story is solid, but there aren’t many times when your background matters. The best parts of the story are actually in the shards, the written parts…which makes sense since it’s a tabletop game this is based off of. There’s also an illusion of choice in dialogue and your actions you’ve taken, which isn’t too uncommon I suppose. There’s also very limited romance options, and only one for each orientation/identity of your V. Additionally, for some strange reason there are only 2 “Joy Toy” NPCs that your PC can interact with…out of the entire Night City with overt sexuality plastered everywhere. A minor complaint, but definitely seems a bit weird. The game aims to be inclusive, which is cool, but feels like it falls a bit short of delivery on that respect.

Gameplay/Systems: 6
Here’s where it falls apart a bit. The actual gameplay feels good, but the AI for enemies and vehicles is just…absent. I haven’t felt legitimate danger at all even on “hard” because the enemies will often just stand there in front of you waiting for you to kill them. The cars will just stop in the middle of the road, and do nothing if you stop them. The game has some aspects and rewards for stealth, but from an efficiency standpoint, going in guns (or blades, or clubs) blazing is just faster, easier, and more effective in every scenario. Crafting is fun, and the gear system is fun. But in 2020 (not to mention 2077) it baffles me that you can’t transmog gear sets. Even Assassin’s Creed Odyssey allows you to do this. Instead you’re often stuck between choosing to have armor or no hat, because they look silly. And let’s not get started on hairstyle/appearance customization after creation. Even in Valhalla, you can get a haircut in the actual game from a barber. That said, the game is still fun and has hooked me for several hours, just chasing that next legendary crafting upgrade and to clear my map.

Technical: 6
Okay, this is where it gets a bit messy. On PC, I have not crashed at all in 34 hours. I have had some broken quest bugs that required a reload, and I have had numerous visual bugs. Most of the time it’s just comical, but when it happens during a story moment, it can break immersion a bit. There appears to also be some kind of memory leak, because periodically the game will slow down for no apparent reason, with low CPU and GPU usage. Saving and reloading in the exact same spot fixes it.

Overall: 7
The game leverages a LOT of visuals, which being so lacking on consoles, I can definitely understand why people who play on them would be really upset. If they fixed the bugs, maybe improved some of the storylines with some free DLCs later, the game could be an 8 or more easily. But as it stands, 7 on a high-end PC. I’m looking forward to finishing the campaign, and for whatever DLCs come out afterwards.",True

"Bugs will be patched eventually....so read this with a grain of salt.

Game is nice, you will be submerged into this open world full of gore, nudity and loot.

Your choices matter, whatever you do will impact how NPCs will react and deal with you,

The story itself is full of plot twists (you need to see all the endings to know how much of the twists there are, one ending will not do the story justice). Make sure to do side quests too, they impact main story options.

Graphics are amazing, need a beefy PC to run it at high settings with 60 FPS,

Music is meh, the techno futuristic genre isn't my taste but each got their own,

Combat is nice but not polished, still buggy at times and OP/Overkill if you know what to use and how to use it. Stealth is also amazing, but also bugged at times.

Crafting is amazing, but also exploitable, so use and abuse.

I recommend this game for its almost never ending content (specially side quests), I would also recommend waiting for further patches.

+ Combat is really fun. It finds the right balance between FPS realism and RPG mechanics. I found stealth to be especially satisfying as well when combined with hacking tools. Though, combat could easily fall into the bullet sponge hell at higher difficulties.
+ Vast customization options to play around with. Weapons, clothing, cyberware, perks, vehicles etc.
+ The story is okay. Main plot isn't a huge part of the game and there are a lot of content rich side activities to do besides it.

- Approx. 1 week after launch, the game is still unoptimized and unpolished. Game breaking or not, the bugs kill the immersion making it feel like an early access title.
- The roleplay illusion. I'm honestly disappointed with how little effect we have on our character's (V) personality and actions. The game gives you seemingly different dialogue options all eventually leading to the same outcome. The same thing goes for the ""Lifepath"" thingy. No, it's more like a starting location. The quests for Nomad, Streetkid and Corpo are pretty much the same except their unique beginnings. Not a huge deal but it's misleading and doesn't add much variety to the game as advertised.
- The AI is pretty awful. The glitchy enemies often ruin a fight and NPCs are lifeless and awkward in general.

Overall: Cyberpunk is a pretty good game. Unfortunately, overhyped by many and still in need of some serious work to polish it. It's not unplayable at this stage but it might be best to wait for a solid patch for a smoother experience.",True
"FYI I have around 50+ hours as I write this review.
This game is an Absolute Masterpiece and the next step evolution in gaming. It is a first game since 2012 that I consider worth buying and spending money on it. Imagine a mix of Mass Effect (the original trilogy), Fallout New Vegas, Deus Ex games, Borderlands loot system, with open world driving and FPS tactical shooting, tactical melee fighting as well in FPS  katanas, mantis baldes and fists hand to hand combat)

Those people who disliked this game are the ones who thought its gonna be another typical GTA, or run and gun Battlefield , call of duty game. Also, the ones who bought it out of hype without considering that this game is an RPG which means you build your character with specific set of skills and perks in order to supreme with SPECIFIC TYPE OF WEAPON, firearm or melee. Until you build your character you always outclassed and always weaker but as you build and level and add mods to your gear you become stronger and stronger. It is sad to see people willing to pay $120 for another linear boring game run n gun shooter, and not appreciating a work of art and a masterpiece like this game is.

Yes it has some bugs (more about it bellow in the buttom of the review) that pretty simple to fix in my case, which I did and didnt had problems with the game for about 50 hours. 

Where it shines? 
Cyberpunk 2077 is an incredible game that keeps you constantly involved in the game! You not just running between NPCs taking quests and submitting them. It is like being a part of a movie or being a part of real life. You go to nightclubs, sit for a brief in VIP rooms, you talk with other characters as you drive in a car, you prepare for missions, develop plan, execute. No matter if it is small talk or a serious mission you are constantly involved in the process! 100% immersion into the game world.

Characters and the story incredibly well written, there are 6 endings that incredible well written and developed too you can see a work of a company who came up with Witcher games and all this accompanied by a soundtrack thats gonna blow your mind and make you shed tears. Im not talking about radio, Im talking about background ambient soundtrack of the game during missions. 

Night City is incredible, it is a big well developed city with different areas(downtown, suburbs, industrial, desert) it is fun to just go cruise around in your cars ( map gotta be like 6 times bigger than GTA V map, and the cars are fast but it still takes time if you just want to go cruising around the map)

I took me about 50 hours to complete the campaign and side stories that connected to the characters from the main campaign (somewhat like Mass Effect loyalty missions). Now I am still looking on 17 Cyberpsycho boss fights, and a lot of gigs and side quests that I didnt even began! If thats not enough gameplay for some people well I dont know what is...hell some of the side quest in the game are better developed that full singleplayers I played in other games.

Considering that you will probably want to replay it with a different build, and yes the game is screamin for New Game+ But I hear its in the works. I really dont feel sitting playing a game for 100+ hours, so than I dont want even want to replay the campaign so I think they nailed it here!

Gameplay is very good, I absolutely recommend playing on very hard so bosses and enemies will actually feel that they requiring some job. Tactical shooting is incredible, you can peek from around the corners and covers ( and you get DPS bonus for that with your perks, so game encourages you to play tactically rather than just rushing forward), sniping is mad fun, melee combat is very simple but FUN (counter attacks, blocks, light heavy attacks), Stealth is okay! Im not a fun of stealth but I had my fun. Driving is very good, a lot of different cars with horsepower, weight data, they handle differently, they sound good, the design of the cars is pure Cyberpunk style (80-90s style merged with futuristic digital technology)

I totally recommend this game, I been waiting for it for a very long time and I am not disappointed.
Too bad that when you create something good this days, it is immediately falls under gossip from the web and people who dont even realize the purpose of the game to begin with.

Performance issues, possible fixes, work arounds:
There are 1.05 and 1.06 hotfixes atm that already fixed a lot of different problems so you should research there first of all.

as for me I am playing on v1.03 with AVX hotfix and I didnt bothered updating the game for now because I wanted to keep playing what was working for me. (don't fix whats not broken)
-Performance: Running on 1080p, i7-920, 18GB of RAM, 1070 GTX G1 gaming, non SSD HDD, Nvidia 460.79, game version 1.03, Windows 7 64-bit. Game runs pretty smooth and well with settings bellow:

Set textures to low, (if you like how it runs try Medium textures), I can run in medium but prefer the extra FPS.
Turn ON slow HDD mode,
Cascaled shadows resoluton to low,
local shadow mesh quality low,
Crowd Density to medium,
Other settings can be set to medium/high to your prefferances (experiement)
Enable Vsync on 30 and set FPS limit on 40 (it doesnt feel like you run it on 30 FPS it feels very smooth, but for some reason this did the trick for me to enjoy the game without suttering or fps drops even during driving, maybe a little bit in the downtown area but not as bad as before)
Go to NVIDIA control panel and set texture filter quality to HIGH QUALITY. (gonna make the game look little more shinier)
Even on low textures game looks absolutely amazing and probably better than any other game out there on very high at the given moment.

game crashes during conversation with Johnny after the Pacifica main campaign?
-keep skipping the conversation forward and use F5 to quick save, reload the game and continue. Once you leave this place it will never happen ( seems to be fixed with later patches)
Game crashes during pyramid song quest with Judy?
-No work around found on my end, had to give up on quest. (seems to be fixed with later patches)

",True
"Yes, you must've heard and seen various of visual bugs and glitches and hard bugs that prevent quest completion, so I'll try not to talk about that, and focus more on the actual gameplay, and why you shouldn't waste your time and money on this game. But let me first briefly confirm that, yes these bugs are atrocious. Absolutely immersion breaking. I mean in the supposed year 2077, when I call my vehicle, this autonomous smart machine, comes and run me over if I don't move out the way? WTF? I guess I'd be lucky if it doesn't spawn on top of other vehicle and explode or pass me by without stopping, or spawn but stop 5 full screens away from me, so I have to run to it or if it somehow not manage to  do any of mentioned above, I promise you, it will spawn the exact opposite direction you're trying to go, so you have to do a U turn. But I digress.

1. A) THIS GAME LIES TO YOU. It gives you impression that it's open world, but it's not. The outer edges of map contain next to nothing, and texture gets noticeably worse as u get farther out, and eventually teleports you back into playable part of map. Many stores and buildings that have doors are ""locked"". Ones that are open are actually tied to main quest or side quest/gigs, so it's not an open map, but a big closed map. 90% side quests are basically extended fetch quests or playing a messenger. Nothing intuitive or interesting. You have to drive some NPCs here and there, but it's nothing to drool over. There's nothing to do in the overworld. It's filled with useless, empty NPCs who runs away screaming if you jump near them.

B) Your choices don't really matter. It barely matters which lifepath you choose, you only play 1 hour worth in the beginning for each lifepath, and rest is the same except for some dialogue options. But even that doesn't matter because there's only one real dialogue options most of the time. Game likes to give you impression that you're building out your own story but no, you are stuck in narrow tracks of predetermined drama. It's cool, but it's not what was promised or advertised. You can choose whichever dialogue options, it's the same outcome. Now some quests are ""pick A or B"" and if you pick one, other disappears, but that too doesn't really matter because what matters is what you pick for the last main quest. This game was advertised as being able to beat by only playing side quests, that's a lie, you can't. There are 5 side questlines, but to get to ending credits, you have to do the main quest. Now that wouldn't have bothered me if it wasn't advertised as such. You can't kill any of the quest NPCs. There's no interesting way to complete the quests other than the one way it was meant to be completed. Boooorrrrrinnng. Why not let me fail the quest by killing the NPC? Why not let me kill children in the game and balance that by having some ultra negative buff that doesn't go away or expensive to get rid of? Why not let me make these terrible choices and deal with it? You don't have any freedom in this ""RPG"".

2. DUMB MECHANICS. A) One of most common sidequest/gig is ""go there, kill them"", but killing them all does not complete the quest. In order to complete, you must find and open the item called ""shards"" in this game, which is basically a scroll that contains WALL OF TEXT. Text which you won't give a two crap about. It provides no lore, just boring same generic text. And if you don't read it or don't find it(or can't because game didn't spawn it, most annoying bug), then the quest remains un-completed even though that quest location no longer contains any enemies you were supposed to eliminate. Soooo dumb.
B) If you played Witcher 3 then you know about the useless mechanic of crafting which you barely touched. Well in Cyberpunk, the dumb mechanic that no one sane actually cared or wanted is back with vengeance. Now, if you want to craft good stuff, you have to invest your LEVEL(50 is max, but in most play through, you'd get to 20~40) and skill points. I mean, i have to take level points and skillpoints on being able to craft ""rare"" and ""legendary"" etc? wtf? This design choice only make sense if this was some MMO RPG where you can sell your crafted stuff to other players, but that's not the case in this singleplayer. If you level up crafting, your weapon proficiency will be dogcrap. But hey, you can always respec skillpoints with cheap price of only $100,000.  -_-;;; really? And you can't respect levelpoints so GL with that.
C) Let's talk skills. They're the most generic, unfun set of skills I've seen in RPG game. Most of them are just percentage gains(1% or 10% etc of base stats like HP or dmg) while wielding different weapon types, that's it. You can't do any unique fun builds. Your only choice is go for dmg and HP or be useless craftsman. Playing this game has taught me something though. Next time Im thinking about buying a game, first check out the skill tree, it'd be good indicator of how fun or boring your character will be to play. I've learned a valuable lesson.
D) Items are bland. 99% items don't do anything interesting. Only thing you're looking for is DPS. Just take the higher dmg and move on. No, there won't be any cool interaction with skills and items other than percentage boost in proficiency in that said weapon or item. I don't care for a ""legendary item"" that does nothing cool or exceptional AND is lower dmg or armor than my ""uncommon"" item. Why would I ever use that? And be careful, I'm not sure if this is intended, but you can't remove modifications on weapons. Once you slot them babies in there, they are in there for good. You can replace with another mods but that destroys previous mod. But that mod is only % increase anyway... so...
E) Hope you enjoy elevator rides, because there's a fook ton of them in this game. Once, I got to top floor of a building via elevator, but I wanted to skip the long elevator sequence, so I tried to jump down(not falling far enough for fall dmg) until you get to a point where it insta-kills you for being out of bounds. Again, NOT open world.
F) THE TELEPORTING COPS. If you commit a crime in this game, police will spawn behind you like some teleporting mage. It doesn't matter if you're out in the open public area or secluded hallways of abandoned apartment, you can count on cops to know the exact moment you commit crime and come try to kill you. Even though when gang NPCs are shooting at each other and nothing is happening, you the main character is always on BIG BROTHER watch. This cop mechanic seems like such after-thought implementation. My disappointment level is OVER 9000!!! Oh, and don't try to get close to them, they insta-aggro you and try to kill you for even approaching. What?
G) STEALTH AI IS STUPID AF. Yup, stealth is so arbitrary. Like how do you not see me right next to you? But you still use it anyway cuz it gives extra dmg. Derp.
H) TERRIBLE AI. You punch a civilian, and they all disappear out of thin air. Enemies just stand there and watch you kill his buddy. Coupled this with bad stealth, you have yourself some pathetically amusing fights. But it's more pathetic than amusing though. Feelsbadman.

TLDR:
Skyrim, which was no masterpiece by all means, came out 9 years ago did everything better than Cyberpunk.
Don't play this game, it will not be worth it. If you're really, really bored, wait til massive sale. But hey, at least it looks nice, right? On PC that is... RIP console users.",False
"[i]""GOOOOOOOOD MORNING, NIGHT CITY."" - Ziggy Q[/i]

Preloaded and been playing it for 56 hours and keep counting, I guess its enough for me to give this game a proper review. Cyberpunk 2077 isn't your regular FPS game, It's more like Story driven-ARPG pretty similar to Fallout New Vegas or Borderlands or combination of both. I'm playing Street Kid lifepath on Very Hard difficulty and it's not as bad as many early reviewers said, Really recommended to play on Very Hard because you will utilize all the mechanics the game offers you (Perks, Consumables, Hackerman, Gun stats, Etc). Starting from the bad stuff I found so far, As expected from a project this ambitious, day 1 launch experience isn't the one I'm expecting with of course a lot of bugs here and there, Bad texture buffer and images popping, Bad framerates, I'm expecting a good enemy, cops, civilians AI but they blew it. It kinda ruined my immersion but not so much because its not happening every second, you get the point. 

Haven't finished the game yet because I love all side jobs they offers you, every side jobs are like a unique individuals, despite the fact that the objectives remains the same under multiples category but what makes it unique is the story behind it and how you approach it. The main story so far are good and they really know how to play with your emotions.

The gunplay is fine just imagine Witcher 3 combat but with guns, animation is pretty sick, and every guns had it's uniqueness and you could feel the kicks too. Found like a lot of pop culture and video games references which I do loved. Having a real blast playing it and totally recommended for you who are into cyberpunk genre and looking to chill and immerse yourself into a good dystopia world.

CDPR promised they will keep updating and patching the flaws post-launch and fingers crossed hope they fixed all the bugs like real soon, remember when The Witcher 3 experienced the same thing day 1 but looks how polished it's now.

also i would have liked it if they tried to make V likeable at all. like even a little bit",False
"The story is the main reason I bought the game, and to be honest, it's not living up to what they promised. I was expecting fully fledged butterfly effect where most decisions you make impact the game and the ending you receive. However, as far as I'm aware the story-line goes in the same exact direction for every player and there is no butterfly effect at all. I tried to make another save where I chose a different life path and I was literally so bored by the second run that I just decided to give up on it. Also, why can I not change my hairstyle or makeup for the entirety of the game?? I feel like that is just basic RPG shit that they looked completely past.

Another thing I've noticed is that the story starts off really strong, it really grabbed me in a way a videogame never has before. Here's the catch, though. After about 17 hours of playing I noticed the storyline was dulling down and the missions weren't going as in-depth as it did in the beginning, which I hated. It feels like I'm just doing a bunch of side missions trying to advance the story.

 Not to mention way over-powered police and gang NPC's. I'm playing on normal and they kill me in 3-5 shots. Then other times the NPC enemies are just flat out not respondent, standing there looking at a wall. I'm not too bothered by graphical or AI glitches, though, and most of mine were very minor and barely noticeable. 

I really didn't wanna shit on this game, but it feels like they have been advertising a completely different game this whole time.",False
"Whenever you consume something like an art product I think it's important to ask yourself what you got from it. I think it's an important part of ethical consumption and the bleak world of Cyberpunk 2077, and the medium itself, shows a world in which we do not consume ethically. The same could be said for me when I picked this game up. I knew I shouldn't have but I couldn't resist seeing where AAA gaming was heading, something of a morbid curiosity for an industry I have much displeasure with. 

I was never excited for this game, in fact I wanted it to fail miserably because of the idea of the game alone. There is no sweeter taste  of irony when a corporation like CD Projekt Red, (a company notorious for it's abuse of its workers and terrible working conditions), tries to sell me a product on why capitalism is highly destructive. It's such a slap in the face to the workers who are actively being abused by the executives of the company and it's also absurd. I don't need a product of capitalism in the year 2020 to tell me why rampant late stage is horrendous. So when I picked this game up and was playing through it I asked myself the important question: ""What does this piece of art mean? What is it trying to say?"" The answer I got was clear: Absolutely nothing. This product is baseless to its core, a very rotten one at that. 

You run about a visually stunning and horrendously robust, busy city inhabited by some of the most unlikable people in the world, literally. However, while there is purpose to setting up characters as a product of their miserable world, of the cast they give you to interact with all of them are mundane and severely uninteresting. This is made most clear with the main character of the game, who suffers from a case of the 'Fallout 4' syndrome. 

V, the main character of the game, is a character who sits in that weak in-between state of a ""blank slate"" and a pre-established character. Like the main protagonist of Fallout 4, V is insufferable. An absolute moron while also a know it all while also a jack of all trades while also a tech genius while also a charisma machine while also a poet while also a skilled marksman while also... The design of the character is to allow you, the player, to choose which path you want to go down in life and 'play the way you want to play'. This leads to severely inconsistent writing for the main character alone. On one hand they want you to experience the world that exists through an experienced pawn and on the other hand they want you to be an absolute nobody who rises to the ranks because the plot desires it. To top it off, V has some awful voice acting. Both the masculine and feminine voice are absurdly dull and have no character to them at all. Every line and dialogue option feels disjointed and the tone can never remain inconsistent because of the obvious re-takes needed to voice a character in such a massive world. Why is the main character even voice acted when they aren't an entirely pre-established character to begin with? They are just ""generic grizzled voice"" the character and it's beyond obnoxious.

I have not met a single interesting character in my playthrough that is worth talking about. They all suck. I won't even waste my time talking about the extremely glaring issue of Keanu Reeves playing Silverhand because he was picked for marketing reasons alone. Brand recognition as an art form so that losers can look at things they recognize and say ""I KNOW THAT"" and call it epic and move on with their pathetic lives. (says the guy writing a Steam review)

Story sucks. I am not falling for your anti-capitalist art piece made by a big company. Genuinely, fuck you if you think this game holds any artistic merit. I will not be preached to about ethical consumption from an abusive company, corporations are not people and your anti-corporation messages mean nothing to me and they SHOULD mean nothing to anybody else.

The game is animated well. The player feels fine. It's cool to walk around a huge busy city. I like how they handle sex appeal and body image. That's all I have to say that I liked about this game. Everything else is played extremely safe, is boring, or is offensive to the human condition. I know a lot of people are having hardware issues, I never did, so take that into account of my experience as well.

As final notes I sort of want to expand on the idea of how they handle sexuality in this game. I think it is an objectively good thing for people to be able to make a character in a game that represents them visually. The move away from gender specific roles and visuals, at least conceptually for the character creation, is a great thing that should be encouraged. While many people might find nudity unattractive or uncomfortable, I think this type of design is a genuinely good thing because it shows that the body is not inherently sexual. The way sexual themes are so in your face is almost a great thing because imagine demonizing sex. This also allows for better representation for transgender people or for people who just want to look attractive the way they experience attraction. I am sure that seeing feminine people with huge bulges or some other reverse scenario might trigger some fight or flight instincts in some people, especially in the gamer crowd, but it's all for the progression of removing body stigma in the real world. All this being said though, I didn't need Cyberpunk 2077 to make me feel this way already since I am very pro sex and pro human in general so I award this game no points for doing something I think should be a standard already. Keep in mind that I identify as CIS male as well, so for all I know people who don't identify as that might feel completely different about the subject matter and that it might be mishandled.

Do not buy this game, genuinely. I cannot recommend AGAINST it enough. It will offer you nothing of value.
I genuinely hope this is the start of the death rattle of AAA gaming and their strive to perfect toxic mediocrity  and the expense of the many workers within the industry. Please support your indie developers and please support the organization of unions for the gaming industry and humans worldwide. Do not fall into the AAA trap of expensive trash.",False

even if the whole drama about bugs or game being unplayable on old-gen consoles is ignored (seriously, who cares. the bugs I've encountered were hilarious and in terms of consoles, let me repeat - [u][b]seriously, who cares?[/b][/u]), Cyberpunk still has some real problems in other departments such as story, characters or even gameplay.

I could go on and on, ranting about main quest being too short, main character having a personality of a doormat or having so many ridiculously OP weapons, which resulted in making the skills & attributes section simply useless...

I just want to point out one thing though. despite Cyberpunk's many flaws, I still spent over 130 hours on the first playthrough alone - [u][b]loving every second of it.[/b][/u] there is just something about this game, which makes me feel very attached to it, and I haven't really had such feelings since playing Deus Ex (which was a failure too by the way; coincidence?

"So I bought this game because I had a sneaking suspicion that Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond was an unoptimized, buggy mess with poor single-player gameplay. I knew that when I was buying this game I might run into a similar experience, but at least it would be better in a lot of other regards compared to Medal of Honor. Of course I was right, but this is a game review, not only a story about how I dodge a bullet. Instead I got hit with a high velocity Airsoft pellet this time. 

I haven't finished the game yet (meaning that I can't give a full opinion on the story yet), but after 21 hours I have a good opinion on what I think of Cyberpunk 2077. 

Cyberpunk 2077 is still great, but needs patching for bugs. I cannot speak about optimization for lower end systems though, as I have a GTX 1080 and a Ryzen 5 3600X that run this game [i]mostly[/i] buttery smooth.


[h1]The Good[/h1]
I love the Fallout franchise (yes including 4 but not 76), so I was excited to try another open world RPG with guns set in a unique setting. The gunplay, while not being smooth like Fallout 4's, is still really good and I enjoy combat with enemies. I would say that most fights I fought did not feel unsatisfying or unfair against equal opponents. If you like Fallout 4's gunplay, then you will like the gunplay here.

In other gameplay regards, the skill tree, inventory, stealth, hacking, and many other core gameplay features are fantastic.* Crafting could be better, but with most of this open world stuff you have to go digging online to help with your search anyways. I would say that its really hard to gain money, but that might be down to me being bad at finding a good way to do it since sometimes I check my bank account and see a bunch of money, not knowing what job I got it from.

The story is nice and many of the characters are well written.* It started off slow at first, but past a certain tragic point in the Street Kid path it really picked up. More playtime through the story can change this view. The atmosphere, graphics, and unique setting make this one of the more fun open world, RPG experience since Fallout 4.
 

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
Notice how I put asterisks next to some lines in ""The Good"". Well lets just do it for the story first since that asterisk next to gameplay is pretty big.

While the story and characters are good most of the time, one thing that it lacks is a character I can relate to. Maybe it was the path I chose, but it seems like many of the characters act like reckless or rebellious teenagers. There's also many times where I want to solve things diplomatically, but I am usually forced to make more reckless decisions for the main storyline. I like killing people [b](IN GAMES)[/b] as much as the next guy, but I don't like doing it when everything could have been handled a lot better if everyone in Night City had a cool head. It really takes me out of the world and makes it seems like my decisions can't make Night City a more peaceful place to live. 

Optimization is still desirable at times. Cyberpunk 2077 runs smooth most of the time, but it gets choppy in others. Now I don't think it's GPU bound chops, but CPU bound chops. That's a problem when it's a 6 core 12 thread CPU with 4.3GHz overclock on all cores. RIP 4 core 4 thread users.


[h1]The Ugly[/h1]

[i] OH GOD NOT THE [strike]BEES[/strike] BUGS, NOT THE BUGS! [/i]

Wow thats a lot of bugs. Now I won't say many of them are game breaking since they really aren't, but why did Cyberpunk 2077 ship like this? One thing to mention is that many large and ambitious open world RPGs that freshly release suffer from bugs (Fallout, Skyrim, this). Now at first I was like ""haha yeah whatever, its just a few bugs that I see from time to time happening."" No that's not the case. It's not a few small bugs, but a lot of small ones. Every 2 hours of Cyberpunk 2077 I play, I find 1 different bug, different meaning unique and differing from other bugs I had encountered before. Every hour I play, I encounter 2-5 bugs.

Whats really funny about this situation is the fact Cyberpunk 2077 was delayed a year to polish the game up. I cannot imagine the game if it was released when it was intended if it took a year to get to this point. Now I am fine with them just sending Cyberpunk 2077 out now and patching more later, but it's surprising to me they didn't just play it for an hour or two and just patch the small bugs that plague the game. Again, many ambitious RPG releases suffer from these small bugs at first, so I am disappointed that Cyberpunk 2077 didn't break the trend but not surprised it followed it.


[h1] Conclusion and rating [/h1]

I'll update the review later on to account for the entire story and the inevitable patches that follow. If you are buying this game as it is right now, I think Cyberpunk 2077 is a good game and worth it. If you are buying Cyberpunk 2077 when all buggy issues have been addressed, then it's totally worth it. I still have some story and world building element's that I have gripes with, but other than that I think it hits the nail on the head in a lot of regards, and perhaps what I may see as issues for me may be nitpicks or unreasonable for some.

Until this game gets more patches, I give Cyberpunk 2077 a temporary score of:

"In it's current state I can't recommend it. It's a buggy mess even with the most up-to-date drivers. Optimisation seems to be poor, even on higher end systems. In terms of the game play, the driving and the gun play is average and definitely is more to be desired there.

"[b]THE GAME WE'RE ALL STILL WAITING FOR[/b]

I've spent 16 hours in Night City and I have to say, even now I still watch the boot cinematic in it's entirety every time.  This game sticks in your head.  There's so much to do that the map is basically icon vomit, but that's what we all wanted.  Freedom to pursue a variety of tasks all over this dystopian hyper-corporate megalopolis.

Act 1 was great and I'm genuinely intrigued by the story that is being unfurled before me.  I've read my fair share of reviews and have decided that taking my sweet time messing around with side quests is the way to go.  I complete main quest objectives at my own pace and often find myself riding my motorcycle around Night City more than utilizing the fast travel points because, damn, it really is a pretty game.

It actually runs really well on my system too despite having an older GPU (1080 TI), and I've experienced very minor bugs that are mostly cosmetic.  Nothing game breaking or crash causing.  That being said, it feels like there's a lot more underneath the skin here.  I hate to use the cliche, ""wide as the ocean, deep as a puddle,"" but a lot of the systems feel unfinished, or still in beta, so to speak.  The one glaring example that has come to light is how poorly the police spawning system is implemented in Cyberpunk.  Especially compared to other games that have similar systems that have been out for years.  There are little nuances that make it feel like the many pieces of this game are all being held together by a loosely tied thread, waiting for a tug in the wrong direction.

Overall Cyberpunk 2077 and the hype that came with it was a recipe for disaster.  The gaming community's seemingly infallible developer / publisher came in swinging above their weight and ended up possibly doing more damage to their reputation than could have been predicted.  I get it, it's hard to scale, especially when the expectations are this high.  I just hope CDPR can redeem itself in the eyes of it's fans and the people who feel cheated in this seemingly early access release.

It really is a fun game, and I plan to spend many hours in Night City, but I also will be disappointed if CDPR doesn't basically pull a Sean Murray (No Man's Sky) and slowly start introducing more of the systems and features that were essentially promised to their customers.

Looking forward to a ""full release"" someday!",True

"At its core, Cyberpunk 2077 is a good game. However, I can't recommend it in its current state.

When I first jumped into the game, I was blown away by the storytelling, visuals, and gameplay elements.

The animations, voice acting, graphics (excluding glitches), and sound design are among the best I've ever seen in a video game to date. The characters really do feel real, which makes them easy to get attached to emotionally. The storytelling is intriguing and has you hooked from one section to the next.

...but then you complete the prologue (which is about 8 hours of gameplay). The world really opens up and you get a rush of anticipation to see what Night City has to offer.

The problem? There's missed opportunities around every corner. Cut content as far as the eye can see. The sheer scale and detail of the world is incredible - but that's just it. It's really just something that looks cool and you can't do anything with it.

I could go on and on about this, but the best way to summarize this game is that it is unfinished. In its current state, it really feels like you are getting half of a game. As you progress further into the story, it feels increasingly unfinished.

If you play Cyberpunk 2077, your first few hours with it will be incredible. Then, the cracks start to show. The excitement turns to sadness as you realize how much content is missing from the game.",False
yes,True
"Feels unfinished, but still a lot of fun. Looking forward to re-playing in about 1 year.",True
"There is a great game here hidden under under tons of glitches and missed opportunities. Yes, as has been said to death, this game is buggy beyond belief and needed considerable time to get to a playable state. Having said that, the storyline in this game is amazing, sometimes reminding me of The Witcher 3 (though not as consistent). Again though, for every great moment there is a missed opportunity, sometimes around features falsely promised in past marketing. Is this a good game? Yes. is this a great game? Maybe. Is this as good as the Witcher 3? Hello no.

PROS:
- Great main quest line with impactful endings that feel earned
- Interesting side quests that support the main story, in some cases feeling like a requirement to complete the game
- Lots of content taking somewhere around 40 hours to (properly) finish the main objectives
- Great number of weapons and items with unique upgrade paths and choices
- Fantastic visual style, straight out of Blade Runner
- Decent number of visual settings to alter

CONS:
- Unforgivable number of glitches, some game breaking, that really drag down the entire experience
- Awful performance, even on higher end hardware
- Missing key features and design elements that were clearly promised in trailers and demos
- The story drags considerably in the beginning and several choices early on have no real impact on the storyline
- The environment lacks detail in execution, the game looks immersive but does not feel immersive",True
"I will always remember my first walk around Night City as one of the best gaming moments of my life. I was simply humbled by the City grandiosity, overwhelmed by its staggering amount of detail, excited by the awareness that whoever made this, shared with me the same vision of what cyberpunk is.

For the first few hours of play, I simply could not get anything done. I wasn't able to walk from A to B for a quest without stopping to take a better look at something that captured my attention.
I really felt like being in a cyberpunk, dystopic world, and that was the only thing I could not forgive this game for not delivering. Everything else can be worked on and improved, but not this. That sense of wonder either is there or is not. And by god, it's there.

All of this, lucky for me, could not be taken away by the terrible decisions taken by CD Project RED management, that led to an unfinished game being released, because that's pretty much evident and synthom of a too common bad pratice in the gaming industry.

"[TLDR at the bottom]

[b]Preface:[/b]
I normally do not write a lot of reviews to this will be more of a rant/opinion rather than full-on review.
I'm usually never buying games at release yet did so with this one as i am really interested in scifi settings (especially darker/cyberpunk ones).
And the experience gained reminded me as to why i do not buy games at release.
I also want to quickly note that i did not go into this game as hyped up as others may have done.

[b]Bugs:[/b]
The game is full of smaller bugs, and while not gamebreaking they can destroy the immersion you may get to enjoy.
However there is also some gamebreaking bugs (keybindings not working anymore, being unable to use weapons/sprint etc.) which are usually fixed by reloading.
I also encountered a lot of crashes at the beginning, though that seems fixed so far.

[b]Performance:[/b]
Optimization is bad, like - really bad. Running at around and (slightly) above recommended specs (and with up-to-date drivers) i only get around 20-30 fps (tested on my brothers machine too with similar results).
Reading steam forums and reddit it seems to be a problem even for people with high-end machines.

[b]World & Features:[/b]
- Nice to look at, yet dead beneath the surface
- NPCs dont feel as alive as in other games (GTA5 for example)
- Driver AI is totally broken, or rather non-existant
- Barely anything in the world (that is not part of the quests) is interactable
- No random events
- Horrible police/wanted system
- No character customization (besides creation at the start)
- Missing basics (like not being able to change between walking/running)

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
While the gunplay can be fun (especially with mixed in cyberware usage) it is by no means enough on its own to justify the price. Melee is alright but great, nor terrible.

[b]Story and Characters:[/b]
While i havent gotten into the story all too much yet the little i saw was really nicely done. The missions have been fun so far and the characters were nicely written and performed.
Even the unique sidequest seem nicely executed and set-up.
Characters and storytelling is definetely the strongest area of this game so far, yet also not good enough for the 60€ pricetag.

[b]TLDR:[/b]
CP2077 is a game with a great setting, well written characters and story and mediocore gameplay - all set in an, on the surface, immersive world. Yet once one looks beneath the surface it quickly turns out pretty dead and boring.
Riddled with bugs and performance issues which let the game down and definetely make it [b]not[/b] worth 60€ or any tripple-A pricetag.
I recommend to wait a few months in the hope that the developers will stick with the game and improve upon performance and missing features while also fixing the many bugs currently encountered. Stay away for now or at least wait for a sale.
If i still could i would refund...

I will update this review should the game improve and my opinion change.",False
It's not so bad at all. I'll update this review in 2077.,True
My soul goes out to console users. But it Riiiiips on pc so id get it if you have one that can run it.,True
"Pros:
- Amazing graphics. Great atmosphere. The world feels alive.
- Awesome voice acting and character animations.
- Good main story and a lot of high quality side quests. There are also plenty of more generic ""gigs"" if you just want to roam around and explore the world.
- Gameplay is nothing new but it's quite fun. Level design is usually pretty good. You can ninja parkour your way around and go guns blazing or take a more stealthy approach.
- If you like open-world RPG's, the Cyberpunk genre and Keanu Reeves, you will love this game.

Cons:
- There are a lot of bugs and while most won't break the game, you may still encounter game-breaking bugs. They will get patched out over time. If you prefer to have a less buggy frustration free experience, wait a couple of months for the game to get fixed. Otherwise if you really cannot wait, the game is still a lot of fun despite the glitches, but your mileage may vary. Personally I have only one side quest which completely bugged out and I cannot complete it until it gets patched.
- The enemy A.I. is a bit lackluster.
- The driving dynamics could be better.
- The game isn't too difficult but there's a lot of random things that will one shot kill you without giving you time to react. (Thankfully the game autosaves quite often, but I after a while I started feeling the need to quicksave a lot too.)",True

"[h1]Cyberpunk 2077 First Thoughts etc etc[/h1]

yo- so lemme start off by sayin- half of this stuff is likely my own fault for not looking into it before actually buying it- but i’m gonna still gripe about it man.

consider it a gentle critique, and a casual review.

[u]please read the review all the way through before commentin anythin.[/u]

i’m used to expansive rpgs like the fallout franchise, or the elder scrolls, so perhaps i’m a bit spoiled- but i’d like to think i’m not the only one when i complain about this stuff.



[b]1. dialogue and voice.[/b]

i’m not sure whhhy- but i was expecting a better dialogue tree. it seems like you get such limited options- hardly a few things before the main prompt.
not to mention v’s voice themselves.
am i the only one that wishes for the rpgs of old where your character didn’t actually have a voice?

now don’t get me wrong here- it’s not that i hate the voices they give you, it’s just that they’re not very- i unno flexible. when i make a character in an rpg i have a very specific voice in mind for them. like when reading a book you can hear how they sound in your head.
i wanted to make a sweet baby cyber boi in cyberpunk- but it just doesn’t work with the ultimate chad voice i hear for male v.
which brings me to another thing 8)

[b]2.character customization.[/b]

hmhmhm boi where do i begin with this.
again, this is likely my fault, for not looking into the customization before getting the game- but it’s just so baD.
i was hoping, prayinG that it would be better before launch.

you can customize your nail color and lengTh.
your gosh dang teeth color.
your pP SIZE.
bUT THERE ARE NO DIFFERENT BODY TYPES MAAAN.

for one of my characters i wanted to make a thicc corpo rat.

there are literally chubby npcs ingame.
why can’t i make a chubby boy :,>
a game that doesn’t have body types immediately loses a point for me.
i love making multiple characters- and making them all look different and neat in their own way.
i just think it's cool.

sea of thieves has better customization than this game for cryin out loud smh and they don’T EVEN LET YOU CONTROL HOW TO MAKE IT. my only hope for this is that somewhere down the road- this game becomes nexus compatible and people throw up some amazing character maker mods.
otherwise my game play is gonna be very depressing 8).

not to mention the guuuys. ugh man. look i like scruffy bois- but what if i wanna make an immaculate e-boi.
you’ve got a beard shadow present on the face all the time i can’T GET RID OF IT AaA.
not to mention they look p old.
mature bois are fine- but again if i’m trYING TO MAKE A SWEET BABY BOI IT DOESN’T QUITE WORK.

please i pray to the nexus gods.
heLP ME.

[b]3. fan service.[/b]

alrigHt.
here’s where things get a lil touchy.

i don’t quite know what to think of sexism- i personally don’t believe it exists in the majority of video games.
however- like, i unno man. you ever notice how in video games the female characters always get these super sexy revealing stripper clothes.
and the guys get this full plate armor.

i’m talking about that.

in cyberpunk the female characters just seem to have better models in general for the game.
they look so much better.
not to mention there’s so much female nudity.

i’m a woman alright.

i waNT TO SEE CUTE BOIS- WHERE ARE MY CUTE BOIS.

i just feel like most games are tailored more towards guys.
mmos- rpgs, the general.
i feel like it’s mainly because most women aren’t actually into video games- so the corpo tailors it more towards guys, which makes sense ya know? i have no ill-will towards em it’s just frustrating :,>.

please don’t come throwing hands at me saying you’re a gorl gamer and you’re upset by this.
if you do you’re missin the whole point of this review.

i’m just sayin- as a girl, i wanna see a buncha nice looking bois, not just a buncha nice looking gorls.
where the hek is my fan service??

fallout 4 had real decent character customization- i unno why it’d be hard to do something like that.

dragons dogma had god tier customization oh my gosh.
i miss that :,>

[b]4. notes general gripes gameplay etc etc[/b]

the combat is p weak kek.
it’s very generic, with nothing revolutionary.
not to mention sidequests don’t actually change character development.

also i find it suspicious the large amount of good reviews they got literally at the launch.

don't get me wrong tho- it's got good replay promise!
allowing for decent hours of content.
but at the same time it feels a little barren?
not to mention you need a pretty powerful pc- i am blessed enough to have one tho.
my heart goes out to all you poor bois that tried to adjust the graphics and found out it did almost nothing.

i'm- i unno i'm not sure what to rate the game.
i guess if you want another neato rpg it's p fun- just don't get it for the character maker.
if you don't care about that tho then go right ahead.

i do however- believe that this game was incredibly over-hyped, and failed to deliver a large percentage of what it promised.

something that really bugs me tho are the three backgrounds you get to pick.
for some reason i expected them to have more of an impact and with different routes- since each one starts off from a different point and it even seems like you go through different events for some of em with different characters.
but somehow- it still feels the same.
like,  i unno it’s a little hard to describe for me, like everything is re-skinned but the same content almost.
kinda feels like the illusion of choice- but hey if you like it then good for you man.

i feel like i’m gonna have to rate this a bad for now.
just because it doesn’t feel like anything they promised- which was clever marketing on their part for sure.
but it’s a little too late to return this game so imna get my money’s worth out of it you can believe that.

who knows, maybe my opinion will change.
i sure hope so :,>.",False

They lied about nearly everything. Its obvious that there are loads of missing features and cut content as you play.

Enough said. Is this the future of gaming now?,False
"77 hours in a week.

This game has bugs, and it has glitches and performance issues, so did The Witcher 3 at launch and CDPR fixed it over time, but people forget that I guess. CDPR shouldn't have released this game on last gen consoles, at least not at the same time as current gen and PC. If CDPR hadn't tried so hard to release Cyberpunk 2077 on everything at once, I think the launch would be seeing fewer issues. With all that out of the way, let's move on.

If you expected this game to be anything like GTA just because it's an open world game with cars in it, I don't know what to tell you, because that comparison is far off base. It's obvious that this game was never intended to be anything like GTA, and it certainly doesn't try to be. It's a story focused open world roleplaying game.

As an open world roleplaying game, Cyberpunk 2077 should be compared to Bethesda's Fallout and Elder Scrolls games, or in some ways to Square Enix's Deus Ex, all of which, in my opinion, this game blows out of the water, at least in terms of story delivery, cast, atmosphere, world building, and combat gameplay. TES or Fallout may win out in terms of replayability and freedom to do random stuff in the world, but I really enjoyed the focused and detailed approach that CDPR took with creating their open world, and delivering us the story in Cyberpunk 2077.

Night City itself feels like a real place, not just a backdrop, sounds and visuals are spot on and lend themselves to making it feel like a real, if small, city. Night City feels like one of the most immersive worlds I've been in in a game, maybe the most immersive. Walking around, or even just looking up, made me feel like I was in a real city.

Weather and lighting effects are absolutely beautiful, too, and more convincing than in any other game I've played. I couldn't stop taking pictures.

Combat gameplay is exciting and urgent, and there's room for many different styles to be viable, for instance, I played the majority of the game, including boss fights and larger combat scenes, with a katana, but you can snipe, use heavy weapons and explosives, use hacking to fry all your enemies, go stealth, or run through guns blazing, with the right attribute and perk points, near anything is a viable option. 

Mechanically, the combat feels a lot like CDPR took a beefier and better implemented version of what Square Enix tried to do with Deus Ex and blended with The Witcher 3. Similarly, the character leveling and development options/progression also feel a lot like Witcher blended with Deus Ex.

The story is very well written, and the actresses and actors deliver better than those in most other games I've played in recent memory, not just games in this genre. Many of the side quests even make for super interesting short stories too, with a cast of memorable characters about as strong as the main story. There are a lot of emotionally charged, and thematically heavy moments in this game, and the cast does an excellent job delivering, and making sure that you feel that.

If you enjoy roleplaying games, science fiction, and/or the cyberpunk genre, this game is absolutely worth the full price. I truly do think that once all the issues are fixed, Cyberpunk 2077 will be the standard for open world roleplaying games to live up to going forward.

I spent 77 hours in this game in under a week, and when I wasn't playing it, I was thinking about it. I've only rarely been so enamored by a game. 

Story, soundtrack, visuals, characters, all phenomenal.

 I hope that people will give CDPR and Cyberpunk 2077 a chance ,despite all the loud noise and problems with the release, this game is an experience worth having.",True

[h1]Breathtaking aspects of the game[/h1]
+ Side Missions
+ Graphics
+ Gunplay
+ Main story
+ Keanu Reeves
+ Being Breathtaking
+ Songs
+ Night City

[h1]Not so much breathtaking stuff[/h1]
- Cut content
- Bugs (most of them will get fixed eventually)
- Controls scheme
- No Quickload
- Crafting system being half finished
- No weapon/car visual customization

[h1]Should you buy?[/h1]
I strongly recommend buying it once all the patches and DLCs are out to have the full experience.

[h1]Summary[/h1]
You can clearly see that there was a lot of work and effort put into this game, unfortunately not always in the right place. 
For example, there is so much written messages in shards and lore in database section, yet I am somehow pretty sure that 80% of the players wont ever read more than 1 sentence. Huge variety of clothes and consumables, again it is nice to have but for majority of the playerbase it won’t make any difference since they will pick the clothes with best stats and never even use consumables.

[b]Playtime:[/b] 30 - 100 hours

[b]Recommended price:[/b] 15-30€

[b]Achievements:[/b] basic / tedious

[b]Overall score:[/b] 8.9/10

Definitely worth a try.


[h3][b]TheGhostik’s personal notes:[/b][/h3]

Since I did not follow the progress of the game development on the Cyberpunk, I was able to enjoy the game instead of pointing at the missing content.
 
Somehow, I found the side missions way more interesting than the main story, looking forward to seeing all the DLCs they come up with.

I really enjoyed the gunplay and melee weapons, you can also go full stealth, but that way you are missing on a lot of fun.

The control scheme is horrible, overlapping keys and unbindable double tap actions like dodge. Whole control scheme seems more fit to the controller than a keyboard.

Basic stuff that was not fixed/added because it was probably not the main interest or mandatory to release the game.For example, disassembling more items at once, moving more items, crafting more than 1 item, and so on…

Missing weapon and car visual customizations (promised to be added later).

No quickloading, I mean why can I quicksave and not quickload if the game is capable of automatically loading the last save?

Game was so overhyped that it was impossible to reach the expectations even if it had all the promised content.

A lot of people are comparing it to the GTA V, I would say that Cyberpunk is way more comparable to Borderlands series when it comes to movement/gunfights and even driving. 
Although the hacking part is more Watch Dogs style. 

Cyberpunk has so many ups and downs that I am unable to fit them all in one review, but I tried to highlight the most important ones.

"EXTREMELY disappointed with how the game currently performs on my setup..... Current setup is 1080ti, i7 8700, 16gb DDR4, installed on SSD..... Running on low/med settings on 1080p with -10% rez reduction and can hardly keep 60fps and when playing the game on low to low/med settings it looks absolutely horrible and blurry, character models and shadows all look worse than games made back in 2014. Also, another extreme disappointment was the Nomad start....CDPR sold the starting choices as huge impacts on the story and they specifically said how you have to go and do many missions and earn trust in the nomad area to work your way into the city....You literally climb a radio tower, drive a car for 2 minutes and then you get a random, poorly edited cutscene that fast forwards you 1 year in time to where you're magically in the city now.....idk, this is all HUGE red flags for me and ill most likely be sitting this one out....Empty promises are a huge peeve for me....and these are on a massive scale......

Oh, almost forgot about the HORRID feel with controls.....They added mouse acceleration with NO WAY TO TURN IT OFF.... They also have horrid latency issues even with vsync off, making tons and tons of input lag show up....I truly dont believe for a second that the team that worked on Witcher 3 worked on this game....theres no way in hell",False
"The game that got delayed more than Brexit! (We do not need a wall of text and photo's to capture a persons attention, so short and sweet to keep it minimal for the short attention of people who see a 'wall of text' and zone out)

No spoilers here!

Graphics: They are lovely! Seriously, no matter the graphics settings you choose, they are gorgeous to look at from the characters to sun raise to reflections, it's all top notch! It does need some more optimising but that will come in time. If you run RTX, put the DLSS to ultra performance on max graphics 1440p I am getting 90FPS

Audio: Really good sounds from the dialogue to atmosphere to little pops from bones breaking. All really well done. All the city sounds with car horns beeping to people muttering, it's all there :)

Controls: There are a fair few controls, but nothing serious that takes a while to master or get used too, it's pretty balanced with a wide selection of keys to change.

Gameplay and everything else after: So, it's an RPG Singleplayer game done on a small map but with a lot of content.

You can drive around in some awesome cars and bikes, even REAL life cars are featured in the game.

You can upgrade your character to suit your play style, from hacking to strength etc.. It's a small list but a larger tree at hand inside each requirement and there is a fair few options to better choose your play style. Coupled with this are the clothing you choose, certain outfits will reward better than others or rep with other factions.

There are 3 different factions to choose from, each faction will have different play throughs with how you are percieved in the game, it's up to yourself on what you want to do but maybe play through on each one to take a look? The same as the play style (Hacking, running and gunning, no killing etc).. You can play this game without killing or shooting a gun, it's all down to how you play the game and what you want to do, your actions and choices with characters will then determine outcomes and maybe some missions do not show because you have chosen an option that killed a character for example, it's all very detailed.

There is a lot going on with the visual kind ranging from flashing boards to cross walks. It's a lot of real depth to take in and something amazing.

The game contains a multitude of options, settings and atmosphere that will keep you going for hours. Side quests around every corner, missions on missions that can effect other missions, it's a next level RPG game to explore.

There are multiple endings which play a part in the options you choose to go through, resulting in some missions unlocking, others not which all depends on your choices in the game.

Yes, there are bugs and issue's but as I write this review a few days after, I am sure in time these will be massively fixed and patched out as CD Project Red are amazing at their trade.

Car chases with shooting out of the window is fun. It offers some really interesting mechanics and gameplay.

Would I recommend this game? Yes, it's a good game and a brilliant story so far with the option to reply the game a different way which is awesome. I would like to do this with a friend in coop, I think that would be great but I know there is a multiplayer coming in the future, we have to wait for that.",True

They are aware the issue and wanted to release anyway so they can grab our cash and they did it successfully. Game totally feels unfinished, lot of crude core parts like UI, AI, lack of choices, balancing issues. Ending was like choose A to have this ending, choose B to have that ending. Doesn't change much, your decisions doesn't matter. So it doesn't fits my rpg definition. Just a game that has RPG elements like leveling and deciding how your character look. Personally I didn't had faith in gaming industry anymore. Everything released lately feels like buggy unfinished mess that just have enough marketing material to sell you a product.

"EDIT: I swear I've gotten killed more by walking on uneven surfaces than from actual enemies. This game is so full with bugs. See about it in 2022 if Its in a good condition by then.

Great basis for a game I still wish becomes something great. But as of now, its filled with cut down features and bugs. Oh, bugs, bugs, bugs and a bit more bugs. Some are funny, some are just meh, some are infuriating. Pls fix. The city looks great tho.",False
"[h1]This game is a BUGGY MESS[/h1]
I play with an i7 3770, 16GB of RAM and a GTX 1650 SUPER (50~FPS in buildings, 40~FPS in the City) and the game installed in a SSD. 

Even with more than a 6-month delay this game has a lot of bugs which I'm finding myself just playing normally (most of them are happening more than once):

[list]
    [*][b]Day 1, v1.03: [/b] 1. Objects not following correctly 'timed' the hands which are moving them, 2. an NPC in T-Pose, 3. Some objects are untakable despite having the icon to grab them, 4. Subtitles appearing after loading a save game despite being disabled.
    [*][b]Day 2, v1.03: [/b] 1. Found an Invincible enemy, 2. Voices from TV shows were cut before time (I play the game in Spanish), 3. a quest wasn't progressing after talking to the NPC (I had to save and reload the game).
    [*][b]Day 3, v1.04: [/b] 1. Some crawl sound effects playing delayed, 2. Motorbike enemies going through trucks in a scripted pursuit, 3. Climbing a wall caused me to go outside the world, 4. Some radio stations sounds louder than others.
    [*][b]Day 4, v1.04: [/b] 1. A NPC walking through my car, 2. A NPC not moving her mouth while speaking, 3. some NPCs appearing out of nowhere, doing mini teleportings while walking or walking without the respective animation, 4. In the same stairs on the floor, some do stuck you from walking, so you have to jump, 5. Sometimes scan effects remains in visuals after using a camera (Had to reload the game to correct that).
    [*][b]Day 5, v1.04: [/b] 1. I look bald when looking at the mirror while having a hat equipped, 2. Companion teleported to attack an enemy in stealth, 3. Footsteps sounds dissapeared while playing (was needed to restart the game), 4. Objects jumping when taking to the inventory something.
    [*][b]Day 6, v1.04: [/b] 1. crash while fighting a mini-boss, who was constantly in the fight changing between combat and T-Pose, 2. A companion got invisible during a scripted persecution while riding a bike, 3. A lighting bug of all the world which forced me to restart the entire game.
    [*][b]Day 7, v1.04: [/b] 1. Subtitles appearing in some scenes despite being disabled, 2. Car doing 'moving animations' despite being stopped, 3. An enemy shoot and hit me through a container, 4. I crashed with a bike into a pedestrian, who make me fly like 10 mts.
    [*][b]Day 8, v1.04: [/b] 1. Sound incorrectly syncronysed with some actions in 'neuros'.

Honestly, at this point I'm finding way too many bugs every single day I play; I'm just tired of counting them all.",False
"A great game ruined by immersion breaking bugs and poor performance. One word. Undercooked.

For example, during a key story moment, Jackie was supposed to pull out a biochip from his head. He instead pulls out a gun from his head which completely ruins the immersion and the feelings that the developers wanted you to have during that moment.

The plethora of bugs coupled with poor performance on a GTX 1070 with a i7-7700K prevented me from completely enjoying the story and immersing myself in Night City. I recommend that you wait until cdpr fixes the bugs and performance issues before buying the game. Until then, I cannot recommend the game in it's current state.",False

"Now that I've beaten the story and mostly done all the side content, here it goes

[h1] Rustin A. Skully's Big Vacation: Night City, 2021! [/h1]

[i] Warning, may contain spoilers and animal product [/i]

[h2] Positives [/h2]
1) Night City from the perspective of visual is a loving homage to some of this particular genre's great city scapes of cinematic and even video gaming past. There were times I felt like I was genuinely back in Tokyo in 2029: It was murky but you could see the culture there. 

2) Despite lack of context and the somewhat rushed beginning, I got the story, and where the emotional moments were, they hit. [b] hard [/b]. I'm not normally hit by video game stories because they're all just fluff, but CDPR have a tendency to make great stories.

3) Except for a teaspoon full (Won't say), I did for the most part really dig the side quests and the character story arcs involved. I think that is one of this games major strengths.

4) There's people saying that the shooting feels particularly limp, but I found that the shooting and the mechanics of firearms in this feels a lot beefier than GTA V's shooting mechanics. Obviously nothing will top DOOM's power trip, but the closest we will get are the tech weapons. Sans the smart guns in this case, I enjoyed the shooting for the most part.

5) The car designs, while some I disagree with, are visually quite stunning and well worked on. The details such as the noise of a V10 engine roaring are such a joy to hear, however, the lack of turbo spooling and blow offs are disappointing, especially with two particular models, you will all know which I mean (I hope).

6) The voice acting cannot go without mention, it adds weight to the side quests and character arcs I mentioned earlier. These voice actors did a wonderful job at portraying their characters emotions, and some just made me laugh [spoiler] Goro's a goddamn riot imho. [/spoiler]

7) While the actual damage model behind the shooting mechanics I think are flawed, I do appreciate the gun design for the most part, even the more whacky looking tech weapons look mad and sound powerful.

[h2] Negatives [/h2]

1) Bugs. Yes, I encountered a few. Sadly, some of these bugs were just plainly too hard to ignore. A couple being related to the Loot description window being stuck, as well as weapon HUD elements being glued to the screen if you don't unequip them. I did encounter a few hilarious bugs including going so damn fast through NC that I made the car I stole become a squished potato.

2) Unfortunately, some of the choices we are given bare no real weight to either character build or story. I'll admit that there is a sense of choice, but not in the same way as say, E.Y.E or Deus Ex give you. Lifepaths in all honesty only unlock some dialogue options and a few unique quests, but no RPG element of giving you a specialty in a particular class which in a Western RPG, I value (even New Vegas had something like this)

3) Looter Shooter mechanics. Simple, they took Witcher 3's loot mechanics instead of just developing a new format, which irks me, I'm not a big fan of collectathons unless there's an end in sight like Dark Souls. I must also complain in this section about the way difficulty scales, making you a glass house while the enemies can sometimes outwardly be brick houses in comparison

4) Some plot points are just plain bad or are written to involve Keanu's portrayal of Silverhand more than having a real sense of plot. As much as I enjoyed Keanu as Johnny, I felt they could've dialed him down in certain story quests and areas.

5) The NCPD jobs are just a pain to go through purely due to lack of variety, same with the fixer gigs given.

6) Honestly, the main story I felt was too short, I'd like some extension of it, maybe if they ever wanted to retry this IP, they could allow us to instead be able to do the things like in [spoiler] doing all those gigs with Jackie in the 6 months before the main plot's occurance [/spoiler]

[strike] 7) A Lack of GEP Gun. Cannot silently takedown Manderley. Everyone else has got 10 seconds before I add them to an NSF Casualties List. [/strike] 

[h3] Conclusion [/h3] 
This is a mess. A mess I personally enjoy. As someone who went into the game looking to berate it for not being like Deus Ex. Instead, I viewed this from the lens of GTA SA/4 and Human Revolution. It's got a bit of everything and I appreciate this game as a time waster more than a challenge.

I'd advice anyone who would want to buy this game to get it in May. March is a big patch drop, and we will know what will become of the IP then. Until then, take care, be well and enjoy yourself. 

[b] Update [/b]: If you can't necessarily wait, and want some sort of Sci-Fi Punk fix, get EYE: Divine Cybermancy and the Deus Ex franchise (just ignore Invisible War). You'll ask for it. May your legs be ok and your Brouzouf gains be strong.",True

"39 hours clocked in the game so far, and i'm sure there will be many more clocked in the future. 

(In this review I will not discuss the overwhelming amount of bugs/glitches I encountered during gameplay as none of them really ruined the experience for me, just note that they are there and very in your face at times.)

So why am I not recommending the game?


Well, in it's current state, Cyberpunk2077 is not the game we have been promised. There are a ton of missing features and the city is what I would describe as ""A vast and shallow ocean."" The city is absolutely beautiful and so extremely fun to walk around and explore, but the more you do so, the more you realize, there's absolutely nothing to do.

Outside of the main story line and side quests (Which were very amazing btw, don't get me wrong) there just isn't any fun to be had. You can do the following things outside of main/side story quests:

1.) Rent 1 of 2 ""Joy-toys"" IE Hookers.
2.) Do the gang pop-up missions that happen every so often
3.) Drive around and look at the pretty lights
4.) Hunt for weapons/cosmetics

That's it. Seriously, that's it. 

There are three or four big strip clubs/places you could theoretically hire hookers/strippers however once you walk in you cannot interact with ANYONE inside of them besides pressing your F key to hear them call you can asshole for attempting to breath the same air as them. Most street vendors, yes, MOST, don't actually sell you anything. There are multiple hot dog stands/outcrop food places that when you walk up to them, you can't talk to them and buy food. There are areas with slot machines/some form of gambling machines littered around, but no way to interact with them or play. There is no way to change your appearance after you have created your character. No barbershop, no tattoo parlors, etc. Most buildings are not enter-able in any way. Multiple story buildings that you can actually enter usually only have one or two floors that you can only access via elevator ride, taking away from a lot of the grandeur, and making it feel extremely artificial. 

Probably the weirdest thing to me at least, are the brain dances. Brain dances were this super big deal in advertising the game, and they're in there for sure. However, you can only do brain dances as it relates to the story missions. I did a grand total of two brain dances. Both of them to gather information for a story related thing. Now, this wouldn't be such a big deal if brain dances weren't such a hyped feature. You were supposed to be able to buy these brain dances and like, experience them as side content (Most of them being hyper-sexualized as is cyberpunk style) It's one thing to just, not include that piece of content in the game, but here's the zinger: YOU CAN GO TO A SEX SHOP AND BUY BRAIN DANCES. They also aren't listed as ""Junk"" They're listed as misc. and there's a tool tip saying ""You don't have access to the software to run these."" ??????????? But I do, I have been doing brain dances. What? This goes to show that there has definitely been some corners cut and content nixed to get the game out in time for Christmas alongside next gen consoles. 

Cyberpunk is truly a wonderful first person story game, it is an abysmal RPG. Which is extremely surprising coming from the same people who delivered the Witcher series. Honestly feels like you're playing a very well written COD with diablo-esk looting mechanics. 

I beat the story after roughly 20 hours of gameplay, I also did a considerable amount of side quests, definitely haven't done all of them, I am however on my way to doing that now. Hopefully those can hold me over until more interesting side content is released for us. In the end, if you'd like a highly narrative game and don't care about experiencing a living, breathing virtual world, by all means dump your hard earned robux into the game. If you want a fleshed out and captivating RPG, you'll probably be better off going back to The Witcher or RDR2",False
"Worth the hype. All the mechanics seem smooth and bug free, we'll see if the story holds up.",True
"Cyberpunk is an astonishing great RPG adventure game where you play as V, a mercenary in Night City. Going into this game having heard what everyone else said about it, you kinda expect the worst. However, playing this you realize quickly that a majority of the people being negatively vocal about it are wrong. Probably because they haven't actually played the game.

The story is great. Best story I've seen in a game in a long while. This includes the characters and their personalities. I'd say that every NPC that you meet and interact with are unique in their own way, everything from the main side characters such as Judy, Rogue, etc. but even minor characters you meet along the way such as the various district fixers, Oboz the clown and Lizzy Wizzy (Grimes is actually a great voice actress, she should definitely do more of this!). I feel the main quests are streamlined but also gives you time and opportunity to play around in the world through exploring, doing side jobs, gigs, etc.

Before I go into the gameplay part, I just want to adress one major issue: A lot of people seem to go into this game thinking it's GTA. It's not GTA and it will never be GTA. The gameplay is solid, everything from the shooting to the quickhacking. Driving leaves a bit to ask for, but it's not really the main focus of the game; I do prefer the more ""heavy""-feeling cars in comparison to the ""easy to crash"" sports car. The world is great to explore, but as many criticise it for, there's not much to actually interact with. That's okay in my book, like sure it's sad you can't actually play at the arcades and such but once again, not the main focus of the game.

The levelling system is good and the skill tree with the various attributes really shows that this is a RPG with big letters. You need to go all in with various skills and attributes to make sure that you can finish quests and side jobs in a satisfactory way. Speaking of that, I love how every quest, side job and gig gives you several different ways to solve and finish them. You can go guns blazing, you can sneak, you can hack, there's several ways in; hard or easy ways, etc. There's so much possiblity to adapt the game to your game style; hence it is a true RPG.

Okay so the game does have a few bugs, I never encountered any gamebreaking ones but I might have been lucky. Also worth mentioning is that you'll reach the end of the main quests around 60 hours in. That's a good chunk of playtime, I'd say it'll be around 100 hours to finish it completely with side jobs and all. Maybe even more if you want to 100% it.

I recommend this game despite what ""everyone else"" says about this game. It is definitely GOTY 2020-worthy and now I'm just waiting for the free DLC and the expansion packs so that I can replay the game, this time with a different type of character and choose a different ending...",True
"It's been so long since I've played a game that compelled me this much! I love this gorgeous World, and this fun game-play. I enjoy it so much! But what the game makes up for in its well written story, gunplay, melee fighting and characters, it has trouble functioning, and it lacks depth in its open world and it's RPG elements.

NOTE: The game as of December 31st of 2020 still has not been improved very much, many immersion breaking bugs still remain in the game. I have experienced only a mission-breaking bug, bugs with visuals, characters not speaking at one point and Ray-Tracing being unplayable. But those sum up the issues I have had with the game. I know many people are having issues that make this game completely unplayable on consoles, and even on PC. So for some reason, I got lucky that I had only those issues.",True

"I HAVE NOT FINISHED THE GAME THIS IS BASED ON 30 OR SO HOURS OF PLAY

I hate to do this, but this game is in a bad state. I'll break down my reasoning for the rating I'm giving the game.

- The Police spawn behind you and do insane damage. They don't even drive cars they come to life from thin air. If you bump into the a few times they immediately start shooting you!!!
- There is no driving AI. Lets say I stop my car in the middle of the road the AI will stop behind my car and sit there for an eternity. If they hit me there is voice lines dedicatied to incidence. They just keep driving leaving me in the road or floating on top of their car
- The NPC are zombies. Walk up to them and try talking to them and you'll notice they just recite one liner and barely interact with you. Not to mention if you turn away from an NPC they can immediately despawn. I have also seen NPCs duplicated before my very eyes. So much for a day/night cycle for NPCs
- Driving physics feel wrong. I am constantly missing turns and cars feel stuck sometimes. The only saving grace for me was motorcycles and sports cars.
- The loot system is meh. I get the same weapons over and over again just marginally better by one or two dps. Clothing is tied to armor so my character was forced to wear daisy dukes because they provided the most armor! THE GAME is all about LIVING LIFE IN STYLE yet here I am looking crazy to protect myself from damage.
- There is no cutscenes for adding cybernetics. My character got his entire spine replaced and I walked out like nothing happened. You are suppose to lose humanity for adding more and more cybernetics. They even mention this in the game! Yet it is not implemented at all.
- There are no random events. You will see the occasional event where you can help the police take down some baddies, but other than that nothing.
- The world looks stunning, but is plagued with bugs. My character was driving a motorcycle and started T-posing. I called my car and it was stuck halfway in the ground. I can go on and on
- Most of the RPG elements are missing. Why can't I play arcade machines? Why can't I go get tattoos? Go bowling? Hang out with friends? It just lacks the little details to make it a great game.
- The story so far is magnificent and I can barely put it down!

I’ve seen some very sexual things, “offensive” things, religious things and so on and I’m so happy that they told the story they wanted to tell. It’s so refreshing not having a story or game neutered by trying to be “PC”.

"RATING 7/10

Honestly this game can only be described by one word ""Rushed"" (Spoiler Alert). It looks like everything was rushed in almost every department. Be it Story, Gameplay, Graphics or A.I. 

So the story started off pretty fun until they had Jackie killed. After that It went downhill, It felt lackluster and booring, Literally the only shot they had at a more interesting character relationship, they killed him off way too early and so the rest of the story from that point seemed pretty lacking. Some certain side missions saved it for me especially Panam's and Rogue's Questline, 

As for the graphics, I dont really have any complaints on this. Graphics are absolutely amazing, those open world textures are simply one of the best I have seen. But they gotta work on that shadow glitch. Its pretty annoying and funny lmao. 


Some dumb shit CDPR added to it

>The Hacking/BD system was also childish, A lot childish actually. Watch Dogs and Nier Automata did a way better job on this. 
>The Cops system and Wanted level is also just dumb, You get only 1 star wanted level and apparently all the cops are behind you out of nowhere? Bruh learn something from GTA. Rockstars knows how this is done. 
>I didnt understand that booring Cutscene structure, It didnt suit the game. Separate Cutscenes would have been a lot better for a game as big as this.

As for the bugs which everyone's been talking about everywhere, I havent encountered a single bug until now except for the Shadows Glitch, maybe just upgrade your PC before lashing out on a game and saying *Its buggy* ??

My personal rating would be 7/10 and most of it is due to the the amazing graphics and some certain side missions, they saved the game for me. The story had potential but they fuked it up.",True
"This game is a disappointment. I am not talking about the bugs. The game is stupidly filled with bugs but I wish that wasn't the case so the focus could be on why it is just a bad game. In summary, from the AI to the story, to dialogue choices, to gameplay mechanics, this game lacks so much. It's like CD Projekt Red just cut down on so much of the actual content that could've made this game what they promised it to be. Nothing you do matters. The only choices you make that truly ""matter"" are in the last mission. The AI is so bad in every aspect of the game that talking about it makes me wonder if they really put 80% of their budget into marketing and Keanu Reeves. I love Keanu Reeves, but I wish they spent more time and money on other characters like Jackie. The intro cutscene after your unimportant lifepath choice just shows how much they cut out from this game. Instead of spending time with Jackie and doing missions with him, you are given this lazy video about how you guys are best friends and did a bunch of shit together. I have a feeling they originally planned for you to actually do those missions and bond with Jackie more, but they ended up cutting it up into a short intro video. I am by no means saying the developers did not work hard enough. I know the team there was incredibly passionate about this game during development. But from a consumer standpoint, they should have delayed the game indefinitely. ""Coming when it's ready"" my ass. One of my friends said they would get Watch Dogs Legion instead of 2077. I thought they were crazy. When I imagined how Legion would turn out to be, I thought it would be another copy and paste Ubisoft game that had a map filled with a checklist of things to do, broken mechanics and AI, and a bland experience. Turns out I was describing Cyberpunk.

Now, throughout my playthrough, I still enjoyed the game to a certain extent. I was completely immersed in my first 2-3 hours of gameplay. The first mission was amazing. Experiencing Night City during the drive with Jackie as the rain fell on your windshield was awesome. Seeing the neon soaked streets and advertisements got me so excited. But it seems like things only went downhill from there... The graphics and style is beautiful. It is actually pretty well optimized on PC, considering how large and beautiful the game is. There is so much detail and beauty in Night City. Too bad it's literally filled with only sex shops that you can't even interact with, and AI shopkeepers that don't give two shits about you throwing a grenade at their face. This game was hyped to stupid levels and it was 70% because of CD Projekt Red's promises and vision for the game, and 30% because of the fan base (which is to be expected from this kind of large project). I LOVE the Witcher 3, where your dialogue choices actually affect the story, the story wasn't rushed and the characters feel meaningful. I wonder how CD Projekt Red can fix this game. Will they completely rework the AI and add the features they promised? Or are they just going to add an online mode and some story DLC? This game had so much potential, and maybe it still does post release, but only time can tell.

One more positive note. The language support in this game is phenomenal. I played the game in English and Chinese and the voice acting is incredible and the facial animations are brilliant and actually match what the characters say.",False

"Huge open world game that is too much to take in at the start. Luckily Jackie is there to guide us around, probably my favourite Npc since Garrus. 

Early days yet so can't see much about story/consequences but the characters so far are all very interesting. It does seem to start off a bit slow however.

Runs like a dream for me at 1440p, Ray tracing Ultra settings.

First Edit :  @ 16 hours

Ok this game is insane, so many different playstyles that you can take and even major characters die if you screw up. The dialogue is really good, characters actually seem to form an opinion of you due to words and actions.


Second Edit : @ 55 hours.

I do have some negative comments to make. The background of V doesn't really have much impact on the story arc. I was hoping that each one, Nomad/Streetkid/ Corpo Origin would be a different story all in itself. In many ways its just like Dragon Age Origins, it adds some flavour but doesn't drastically change anything.

I did have several occasions where I could respond in corpo fashion to npcs but this never felt like it changed much.

The driving in the game is awful, cars feel way too light and you're forced to use third person camera as the PoV in first person is terrible, combine this ofc with no mirrors! ..and you can see why its a problem.

Back to the positive :  Side quests are nothing short of exceptional. There are several that are very well written and also open ended. I would argue that some of the side quests are better than the main game story arc.

I will drop another update when I finish the game.



Final edit : @ 85 hours

A good game but not quite the level of Witcher 2/3. I just get the feeling that if they had a few more months of dev time there would have been some more side content. Alot of the side content is  very memorable but the police interventions in particular get old fast.

I really enjoyed the main story arc, its not for everyone though as :

I managed to get 6 of the 7 endings, apparently there is a secret ending but it changes very little narrative wise. Grim ending for the protagonist which was to be expected as its a cyberpunk setting. What is more depressing? That the majority seem to have just blasted through the main story line which locks them into one ending w/ 2 sub endings. This is by far the worst outcome for V imo and I can see why many hate the ""ending"" because of this.

Do yourself a favour and do the side quests and gigs ! You will then have access to 3 other endings which are far better for closure.

I give this one 8/10, origin stories having more impact, the city having more interactive npcs are just two things that I mentioned that bring the score down for me. Definitely worth buying though.",True
"Meh.

Wanted Cyberpunk Witcher, got hookey Cyberpunk Division/GTA

It's clear that within the past few years, marketing was hugely successful and brought in a new demographic than just Witcher players. And they scrapped what they wanted to do a few years ago for this GTA knock off, because, corporate business gotta make monies. Multiple cities over a sprawling map would've been revolutionary, bugs aside, this is a very shiny/pretty copy and paste, with the perception of more choice than you really have.

Also their excuse of cutting the game length down as 'very few people finished the witcher and therefore, we're going for short campaign with replayability', like ok, but how many people replayed Witcher if they didn't even manage to finish it? That logic makes NO sense, and sounds lazy. Anyone who's finished the game will know how special it is.

You generally expect a developer to stay true to their roots. Ie, you can always tell a Arkane Studios, Ubisoft, Rockstar, Blizzard, Bethesda game, even if it's another IP from the same developer, they keep their individuality. If you go into this expecting to feel like its a CDPR game, you won't.. And to me, that's a bad thing.. They didn't need to change as much as they did about the core game and people would have loved them more for it. Instead they decided to copy a slew of other developers, and this is what happened. Why try to 'fix' what isn't broke.",False

"The best compliment I can pay it is that it in decades of playing all manner of games across all meaner of eras, I don't think I've seen something that was as immersive feeling as this game. It is something else in it's ability to set a mood both is visuals and sound. I said to someone yesterday that at times you can just about taste what is happening and I don't think that is an exaggeration. The world feels real and lived in every way possible though this medium.

As for the game itself best way I can describe the game is if Borderlands 2, (new) Deus Ex, The Division and GTA V co-parented a game together. The game sits in a unique spot at the cross-section of action shooter and RPG  that makes it seem both familiar and something new. The gunplay feels very solid and exploring the world is endlessly cool. I have to take a break to do real world stuff today, but I absolutely cant wait to play more. 

I was pleasantly surprised that the game is essentially a sequel/continuation of the old Cyberpunk 2020 RPG - I had presumed it was going to be more of just a reboot using the franchise elements, but it actually tries to present a 'this is what happened' move forward. My playgroups in HS were more into Shadowrun so I had only read some of the books back then and never got to play it. Despite that, I was still excited to see 'old' netrunning decks and Spider Murphy show up in a flashback sequence, though - the nostalgia isn't as high for me on this as others, but its an attention to detail that warms the heart.

Game is not perfect - bugs are real (the NVidia update helped a lot though), the melee combat is kinda ass, and the writing early on did suffer from Coolist F'in Guy syndrome due to some trying-to-hard edgelord tendencies. However, the script has improved as the game has progressed and the story becoming more and more compelling. Also the female V voice is way, way better than the male voice - so much so I kinda want to restart so as not to be chained to Chad McChadinstien for the next billion hours. 

Word of caution though - I bought a good-ish PC a year ago that had specs beefy enough to run the game on High at a good FPS clip. Evidently it runs like boiled carp on old machines, so buyer beware.",True

"First Impressions of C2077, sure its buggy here and there but other than that currently it was well worth the wait as far as I am concerned after playing it for 2+ hrs! I'll get into the pros and cons as I progress but right now this is just what I think atm as currently it hasn't disappointed me in any way either. Additionally, just to set the record straight for those griping about the buggy state of the game, it is certainly playable just buggy in spots for instance voice over animations can sometimes lag behind or not move at all. However, Knowing the devs track record with the witcher games, I am very certain that we will see some patches to fix, address, and optimize the game moreso over time, just a matter of when is all.

And Onto My Review...


+ PROS +
+++++++++
+ It Has Keanu Reeves! That's a Plus!!
+ Decent Graphics
+ Decent Audio
+ Fantastic Story
+ Runs Decently on my gaming rig and I'm slightly under the min spec although theres still lots of problems
+ Inviting City
+ Really Fun Cars
+ Lots to Do
+ Fun Missions
+ 3 Main Campaigns, not just 1
+ Lots of Side Quests
+ Random Events and Missions
+ Can Interact with lots of Random Things
+ Sex with JoyToys is interesting
+ I trust the Devs will fix it over time, The Witcher had a bad start as well and was drastically improved


- CONS -
------------
- Romance is very limited which is suprising
- No Cyber Strip Club that you can hang out at, seems to be limited to just JoyToys which kinda sucks
- No Speeding System, can race around without any hitch
- No Gas System, I guess I can let this one slide though since its the future
- Lots of Buildings that say Locked, this is disappointing
- Some of the missions feel very linear
- Lots of Glitches and Bugs but honestly I expected that
 

= VERDICT =
============
= All In All, its off to a very rough start and I can understand the frustration and see why there's a huge fuss over things but if you give it time and patience (nobody seems to have this anymore with games..) then you'll come to realize that this game WILL get better as the devs release updates. I think the reason it failed for some is that they promised a date, re-negged on it, then players got pissed off due to no patients and sucked into the hype then griped at devs over it so they pretty much were left with no choice but to release it and realistically this game should've waited for at least another year and it would've been perfect. So yeah this is a problem on both parts. Regardless though, imo, I'm very happy with the game even with all the problems that I know will get fixed. I definitely do not regret buying it at all and I think its worth the price mainly because it'll give the devs more reason to improve, fix, and add to it in due time.

"Look, anyone reading this probably already knows why this game is getting a thumbs down. I reinstalled it after the 1.1 patch in the hopes that the game would function better and I ran into a bug within 10 minutes that completely prevented me from continuing with the main story. Loading saves does nothing, the bug happens every time.

This game is still utterly broken to the point where it is, still, actually unplayable. Everyone already knows this and I am just babbling into the void. What a disappointment... I feel bad for all the people who sacrificed their time and sanity on this game for it to not only be released in this state, but to still be fundamentally broken as of this review. Forget the fans, CDPR's employees deserved better.",False
"I would wait a year or two for a definitive or ""enhanced"" edition.

Untangling how I feel about various aspects of the game and attempting to see the game objectively for what it is can be quite a challenge, but here's an attempt... Just FYI, I've played through the whole game to completion, finished all of the side content (inc. gigs and NCPD dispatch events), etc.

Beyond CDPR's mismanagement of the development, the release, and subsequent events, the game itself has issues or suffers from bad design at various levels -- some superfluous while others are architectural to the whole game.

The following is a bit of an extremely simplified overview of what I mean:

[list]
[*] The game have [i]a lot[/i] of superfluous bugs and glitches that breaks immersion, blocks or derails progression, or might even be game breaking. Many of these can be ignored, though some might require a reload of the latest, or an older, save file to work around.

[*] Many of the more core gameplay elements suffers from barebone and/or rushed implementation, not properly thought out, or other similar lackluster matters.

[list]
[*] Like everything related to cars and driving, from how the cars are managed, to how NPCs lack any actual dynamic component to driving and are merely following a predefined static route, to how cops/enemies seem to lack any actual chase or driving mechanic. Even in the car races you can constantly see the opponents transport closer to you on the minimap whenever you get too far away from them (which happens all the time).

[*] To not mention the overall perk system, with what basically amounts to unimplemented perks (as in, there's perks you can waste a point on that has no actual impact at all) or useless perks (such as crit change/dmg increases of 3-9%) where any random weapon (or end game clothes mod) exceeds the values given by the perk(s) by a shit ton, to arguably important elements being locked behind perks/attribute levels (e.g. regain mods when disassembling stuff).

[*] And many other gameplay elements, such as the lack of exploration, the overall skill progression manner, the useless nature of consumables, the inventory (and weight) management as a whole, non-interactable and superfluous game world beyond the typical vendor NPCs and (often) premarked side content.
[/list]

[*] Beyond that the game also suffers from limitations in its narrative, with stuff like how the story progression and ending discourages replayability or how the important characters/NPCs have no actual interaction beyond their three side quests. Overall, the game would've benefited vastly from a proper multi-branching story arch instead of the few minor differences it has.
[/list]

Because of how multifaceted the game is, and how it's essentially all over the place in terms of quality, it's impossible for me to boil the game down into a single score since that depends heavily on what aspect I focus on (e.g. sole core story experience, or immersion, or replayability, or overall game world exploration etc).

And so I can only restate what I mentioned at the beginning: I would wait a year or two for a definitive or ""enhanced"" edition.",False
Misleading marketing,False
"So hard for me to stay focused on the storyline, almost 2 hours playing and i still don't understand single thing. You meet someone, then someone else calling you, then u meet another person, everyone keep talking at you stuff you don't even understand. You need to do this and then you need to do that and it feels like it's not even connected or giving any sense. Maybe it's because i played only for 2 hours, but still. I just simply missing the ""wow"" moment.

Enough chit chat, here are my reasons!

- Gunplay is hard and not fun because the game is not smooth (feels like 0.2 second delay on mouse input)
- My pc is not that trashy but sometimes it drops almost below 60 fps
- Feels like you don't have much options > just go how the game wants you to go (but yeah, 2 hours)
- Problems that people have in this world feels so edgy and childish (you got problem? let's kill each other)
- I was yawning, not wowing
- I don't like reading books but this game thinks that i do
- Where is the freedom and options? Do i need to play like 5 hours to finally enjoy the game?

Oh man, it seems that i am kinda mad... I am not, i am just feeling sorry for myself that i ate the hype again...
My opinion, if you are enjoying the game, don't even think of giving a single f*ck about this review.",False
"I've already reviewed this game but after putting many more hours in I wanna say this:

DO NOT BUY THIS SHALLOW EXCUSE FOR AN OPEN WORLD RPG.

Customization is lack luster, starting off you can never see your character, not in reflections, cutscenes, or even when you're buying clothes.  The only time you can see your character is if you're in your inventory or you're opting into it by looking into the mirror.  And even when you can see yourself, god is it awful.  You can't change the physical appearance of your character after you create it and the clothes they offer you are mondane at best.  There are some pretty cool armors but you'll mostly be focused on how many mod slots a piece of equipment has over its actual stat value so with NO transmog system your character will run around looking like an idiot.

The open world aspects are 2 gens old.  NPCs don't have daily routines as advertised, nor do they have any interesting interactions unless they're already a character in the game.  They just trudge through the streets roaming the block 4 times till they despawn and you see the same exact npc 2 seconds later.  No police chases as advertised, npcs literally don't know how to drive outside their set path, and they have 2 reactions when you pull out a gun, duck or stay there.  The AI is mind numbingly dumb.  Some of the side quests are interesting.  Thats about it.  The little run-ins with gang members are always in the same spots and will always respawn, so no random encounters nor do your ingame choices affect any of it, unlike how it was advertised to do so.

The writing in the game is pretty solid, if it were advertised as a linear fps story.  There are some really good parts but your friendship with Jackie seems very shortlived and rushed in order to fit other story elements in the game.   There is quite literally about 2% of dialogue options in the game that affect anything.  The other 98%, which is a lot because most of this games custscenes are sitting and talking, have no meaningful affect on the story.  Not only that, the only things that change with what background you choose to start from are the first few hours of gameplay, after that it's quite literally the same, even with the specific dialogue options you get for each one, nothing changes.  It's all the same outcome.  The choice of illusion is embarrassing.

The gameplay is buggy and unrewarding.  It feels clunky and half the skillpoints you can use to upgrade your trees go into pointless abilities that literally don't exist or have no rhyme or reason to because they should be things you should be able to do by default, or there not meaningful enough to warrant spending your skill points because why would you worry ab increasing your headshot damage when a weapon already has a modifier on it for it?  Weapons look bland and are really only cool to look at if it's unique rarity, and even then they feel bland in most cases.

Sound design is objectively awful.  Many things are missing from cutscenes and normal gameplay.  Thats all.

Don't buy this game.  It's rushed, poorly designed, and has a lackluster story with false promises of choice and promises that were never fulfilled.  Any review here saying this game is good is looking at it in rose tinted glasses.  This game looks beautiful and is miles wide but very, VERY shallow.  CDPR should be ashamed of themselves and everyone who made the devs rush this game out should be fired.  This game needed at least another 2 years to live up to the promises they made.

"[spoiler]Все xyйня, Миша, давай по-новой...[/spoiler]

She pulls my trigger, got me up all night
It's a danger pretty here in Night City

Впечатления от игры постоянно менялись. Так что напишу новые.
Да, забагованная до ужаса. Да, многие обещания не выполнены. Дебильный АИ неписей в городе. Не очень производительность, при этом местами игра выглядит стремно, особенно днем и особенно вода.

Но для меня это всё с лихвой скомпенсировались СЮЖЕТНОЙ ЛИНИЕЙ! За последние лет пять из игр, сравнимых по вызванным сюжетом чувствам и впечатлениям, в один список могут встать лишь РДР2, Якудза 0 и, разумеется, еще один шедевр от курваков - Ведьмак 3.

Какой же здесь сюжет.. А какие слезовыжимательные концовки! А Джонни!

Побочные квесты тоже доставляют, особенно линии, связанные с напарниками. 

Невероятно проработанный, разнообразный, многогранный Найт Сити. Столько усилий и креатива вложено во внешний вид города и окрестностей, размеры которых - моё почтение. Игра - генератор скриншотов.
Классная музыка, не могу перестать слушать собранный плейлист уже который день. 

Теперь жду патча 1.2, чтобы пройти сюжет снова, в этот раз за CORPO-V.
А потом, если доживем, наверняка будут такие же крутые сюжетные длц, как и к Ведьмаку 3.

В общем, не обращайте внимания на негативный фон скама из твиттера и ""геймеров в ярости"", Киберпанк 2077 однозначно стоит покупки и прохождения. Такие эмоции в нынешнем геймдеве крайне редко встречаются.
А без киберкурваков только и останется инди кал, да конвейерные сжв юбисофтоподелия, что к играм отнести никак нельзя..",True
I dont know why people have fps drop or cry that the game is full of lags. Mine is perfect.,True
"100% worth the Eddies! Don't be a gonk, buy Cyberpunk 2077 today!

That said, I would like to see CDProject add more ""fluff"" as in immersive features to the game. Let us sit at bars and restaurants and see our character eating/drinking what we order. Add in some minigames, let us gamble on them. Add in more street racing/death races and allow us to gamble on those. Let us dance in the clubs PLEASE!",True
"TLDR: Great game, definitely worth the money even if you just play through the main story and don't mess with side missions. Story is one of the best I've every played through, connections to characters is really strong. The only downsides are the performance, and some balancing issues/bugs that will most likely be fixed after content patches. For the hardcore RP'ers out there, there is a lot to be wanting, but hopefully mods and added content will help fill that void.

[b]Honest opinion right off the bat, one of my favorite storylines I've ever played. However, there are a few things to take note about this game right away that detract from my positive review.[/b] 

1. Performance
-Even on a decent computer this game is quite a tank, so hopefully in the future it can be optimized better

2. NPC's and AI
- Police are absolute garbage, they spawn in front of you and have no sense of anything
- NPC interactions are very limited even among main characters (Panam, Judy, River, etc.)
- While not a necessarily a big problem, the rest of the NPC's are braindead and talking to them feels just like it does in the Witcher series, which is slightly disappointing considering how much CDPR said this game was revolutionary in terms of the RPG aspect

3. Difficulty
- I'm going to be real honest with you, this game's combat is so easy it's almost not fun at end game
- The hardest difficulty should have the enemies scale with your progress, it's not much fun when I can go around one shot body shot killing everyone without having to try
- Stealth is honestly not that bad, however when you get into ""combat mode"" it can seem a little overboard when everyone in the tri-state area focuses you even if they're not in the immediate vicinity

4. Buildings/Areas
- This isn't a huge issue either, but I'd like to bring it up. There seems to be a lot of places with the OPEN sign lit up and of course you can't enter, which even if you couldn't interact with anything in there, at least let me go in and explore.
- *bonk*[i]*go to horny jail PieBoy*[/i] The amount of sexual related themes in advertisements and just walking through the streets leads me to think that there should be more clubs, or something to ""explore"" ;)

5. Roleplaying
- This is my biggest issue, like stated before there are a lot of things that are advertised in game that seem like they would be crucial to life in Night City, but aren't included in the game. Maybe we'll see some of these things added in the future: Strip Clubs or other themed clubs, Braindances (since they seem like such an integral part in the game, why are they limited to specific missions?), followers - so I can go on a date with my romance :') 

6. CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION
- There is no customizing looks beyond clothes and cyberware, which aren't lacking I like them a lot, but the fact that I can't change hair, hair color, or anything else on V, really annoys me. Are we to believe that in all of NC there is no barber, tattoo artist, etc. so that we can change the character
- In a game where the gameplay is supposed to be next level, no customization besides the very limited character menu, which is very disappointing in my book, there should be those things to be able to customize things in V's life to make it feel more immersive, without it I feel like nothing has my personal touch 

[b]With all those negatives out of the way I dont think I can fit all the positives in the rest of this review before you get bored and stop reading, so here are some of the biggest things that I enjoyed.[/b] 

1. Night City
- This is without a doubt the best world I've ever played in an RPG, there are no words to describe how detailed and massive the city is, you just need to see it for yourself
- The badlands leave some to be desired for, but overall I like the style a lot and I feel it is leading into a DLC that relates towards this area

2. Storyline
- 10/10 on the story and the main characters, from my first playthrough alone, I felt a strong connection to all the people I met in my journey as a merc in NC. The romances are very good, they work super well and the emotions really connect me to the game. Hopefully this will be expanded upon with the DLC, because... well I miss Panam and Judy already ;)

3. Clothes/Weapons
- Some people may not totally agree with this but I really enjoyed all the clothes types and weapon types, the balancing of these isn't the greatest right now, but I'm not completely turned off by that. The weapons in the game are very cool and fun to use, and I really like all the clothing options, but at times it can be difficult to find a certain piece of clothing

4. Choices in story and endings
- This is by far one of the coolest things about the game, during my first playthrough I didn't watch anyone else play the game until I finished, and when I did and started my second playthrough doing quite a different playstyle, I was amazed at how different entire missions were when I choose a different option way back at the start of the game
- Bouncing off the first bullet, watching streams and videos of people doing quests different from the 2 ways I did them was super cool, this many options really lends the game longevity
- The endings are superb, there are SEVEN, count em, seven in total! Such a suprise to see so much variety and how each of them feel. The amount of ways you can include main characters in the specific endings is something that really make the game feel whole and that its not just a scripted ending that is followed strictly

Hopefully I will be able to change some points on this review in the future, but as it stands now I do recommend the game, maybe not on PC/Console if you dont have the horsepower, but rather on Stadia/GeoForce Now. I'm having a ton of fun in the game still and I hope that modding will make me put hundreds of hours into the game in the future, have a wonderful day gamers <3",True
"1.1 introduced a new game-breaking bug where Takemura will call you but not say anything. This completely blocks any more progress as you can't do most of the interactions in the game while in a call, and you can't save. 67 hours down the drain.

The story is great and every quest are as great, each one of them as their own story it is not just ""pick up this, kill this person"". Nope just a lot and interesting stuff about each characters. You will love doing all side quest!

"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Cyberpunk 2077. The story is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of post-industrial theory most of the points will go over a typical player's head. There's also V's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his/her characterisation- his/her personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these points, to realise that they're not only blatantly true- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Cyberpunk 2077 truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humor in V's existential catchphrase ""Your such a gonk choom!,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as CDPR's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them.

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Cyberpunk 2077 tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid.",True

It is so good to be back in Night City which by the way is doing not so well with the....china plague. They never call it that, I do. It comes from China, the CHINA virus. Your governor doesn't want to open up your city, business is failing, stores are being looted theres rioting, people are really in a warzone its a disgrace. Its like a third world country.

"GTA but not GTA, lots to do, options, many missions have more than one path to get there.  Lots of talking, almost like watching a soap opera, many times I just run to the bathroom or watch pornhub, come back and they're still talking and going on about something, thank god for the skip option, otherwise it would probably take as long to finish the game as it took them to get it to us.  Visuals are good, voice overs are great, I use a nVidia 3090 RTX, maxed everything 4k HDR, smooth as butter, HDR is really well done.  Map is huge!  Cars are not smooth as GTA, feels like you're driving a lego block around, sometimes on ICE.  The AI isn't too stupid, it's actually pretty good, except the police, they just run out there some times, sometimes they take cover.

Overall great game, you'll spend more time masturbating than actually playing the game with the 3 minutes of game-play and 20 minutes of dialogue , min two monitors, one for pornhub, one for the game, not like the conversations have much value.

BTW people are saying its really buggy, I can state that the 20+ missions in, no major bugs.  I had one crash, and one weird thing where I randomly died driving and I hit a trash can.......I mean when GTA V was released I recall a lot of bugs, this is minor and most will be easily fixable, hardly makes the game unplayable.  The cost is justified for volume of content.

Other cool things, its like GTA and Deus Ex had a kid, the hacking is kinda neat, rpg elements are good, the review of memories is cool, weapon attachments all adds to the ""total experience"".  I have over 19000 games, few bring me back as I get older as a gamer, this is a new one that brought me back.

The game got crunched, delayed for 2 years, went ""gold"" and then still comes out like this. I honestly think people are just reviewing this well cause they are trying to ignore the deep disappointment inside their hearts what came with waiting for years for this, and I understand everyone completely. Still, the story is bland, optimization is awful on every single platform with every single type of specs. Bugs, witch are of course expected of a new release are still overly available everywhere on every single stage of game progress in a large scale.

Overall I just wish that people would review this honestly when reviewing this with the product shown in trailers. 
I remember the thousands of comparisons in watchdogs and its trailer and gameplay. Watchdogs got absolutely shitted on for this. Cyberpunk? nonono kawaii keanu and our posh little CD Project Red couldnt eevurr release something bad right guys?!?! Haha dick customisation bruh cool pog moment 100. I love Keanu Reeves as much as the next guy but be realistic guys and don't let another developer get away with a shit blatant lying release just cause they used a YOUAREOXYGENTAKING guy...!!

Edit: HAHAHA they officially changed the game from an RPG to an action-adventure game lmao. How tf can people still go along with CD project red when they oh so blatantly lied to us with the ""hundreds of different storylines and options"", the interactions with NPCs don't affect literally anything.",False

"Pros:
Well anything besides the technical stuff.

Cons:
The recommended Specs are... a joke.
Essentially i meet the recommended system by a fair bit, i7 6700k, GTX 1080 @FTW Edition.
Well what i get ingame? Low-Medium @ 85-100% res scaling to meet 60fps.... well between 20 - 70 FPS.

Guys for the love of god, get a good budget ready to upgrade your shit.
Also (but this is only for release) the game has some animation / clipping / general bug issues. which are minor, but they exist, keep that in mind.

Well, those are all fixable things tho, i can bet that in a couple of months, this game is probably going to be the best game of the year even technical-wise.",True

My specs are above the recommended specs, have everything on low, and the game won't even hit 40 fps consistently, when I am in my apartment, I get a feeling I am still in a quality made game, everything looks nice and smooth, 60 fps constantly, but as soon as I open my apartment door, it felt like I got transported to a game world that's made by Bethesda and Ubisoft, pedestrians T posing, people just teleporting, phasing through objects, stutters, lags, audio glitch, crashes, WHAT. THE. FUCK. CDPR, it took you 8 years to make this buggy pile of cyber trash?

I am partially to blame for riding the hype train, but dear god. This is terrible, I am sad because I wanted to love the game, I really do, yet the poor optimization and the myriad of bugs are stopping me from doing so.

"Cyberpunk 2077... İnsanların yıllardır beklediği ve beklentilerini tavan ettiği o oyun. Bu oyun benim ilgimi E3 2018 oyun fuarında fragmanı ile çekmişti, oyun harika duruyordu ama belli ki daha bekleyecektik çünkü günümüzde bu grafikler akıl almaz seviyedeydi ""bunu hangi sistem kaldırabilir ki?"" diye düşünmüştüm (ki daha sonra haklı çıktım hiç bir sistem kaldıramadı :D) 

İlk olarak yaşanan teknik sorunları bir kenara bırakmak istiyorum oyun oynanamayacak durumda değil çünkü. Bu incelemede bundan bahsetmeyeceğim.

Oyunumuz 2077 yılında geçiyor, ana karakterimizi bizim oluşturduğumuz, nasıl biri olacağımıza, nasıl bir oynanışa sahip olacağımıza karar verdiğimiz bir Rol Yapma Oyunu demek isterdim ama maalesef işin rol yapma yönü oldukça zayıf. Genel kitleye hitap etmek ve oyuncuların genel isteği üzerine rpg ögelerini azaltacaklarını söylemişlerdi ama bu kadarını da beklemiyordum. Oyunda level ve skill sistemi olmasa oyuna rpg diyemezsiniz. Oyundaki diyaloglarımız bir kaç kritik an dışında hiç bir şeye etki etmiyor ki ben ettiğini oyunu bitirdikten ve oyunun tam olarak 5 sonu olduğunu öğrendikten sonra fark ettim. Bu eksi bir yön mü kişiden kişiye değişir ama ben rpg bekliyordum beklediğimi bu açıdan alamadım maalesef. Bunun dışında nedir Cyberpunk 2077:
 
Adından da anlaşılabileceği üzere 2077 yılında paralı bir askeriz. Arkaplan hikayemizi seçip oyunun giriş kısmını tamamladıktan sonra asıl oyun başlıyor ve kendimizi Night City'nin karanlık olayları içerisinde buluyoruz. Her şeyden önce kendi yaşadığım şoku anlatmak istiyorum; ben bu oyundan daha aksiyon odaklı ve canlı bir hikaye bekliyordum ama hikaye bir ara o kadar garipleşiyor ve kararıyor ki izlerken şok olmuştum bunu söylemek istedim. 

Hikayeden girmek istiyorum konuya, hikayemizin ana odağı oyunun giriş kısmında yaşadığımız olaylar sonucu kafamıza biz çip takıyoruz ve Keanu Reeves'in canlandırdığı Jonny Silverhand ile bu esnada tanışıyoruz. Johnny Silverhand oyunun ikinci ana karakteri diyebileceğimiz bir kişi, neredeyse çoğu olayda var bize bazen yardımcı bazen köstek oluyor. Beynimizin içinde yaşayan Silverhand Night City'nin eski efsanelerinden. Kendisi zamanında oldukça ünlü bir Rock yıldızı. Anlattığım olaylar sonucunda ise hikayemiz başlıyor. Daha fazlasını söyleyemeyeceğim spoiler olacağından dolayı.

Peki ana karakterimiz ? Kimdir bu V ? diyecek olursanız bunu siz seçiyorsunuz :D Cyberpunk 2077 her ne kadar zayıf bulsam da bir Rol Yapma Oyunu ve neler yapacağınıza siz karar veriyorsunuz bu yüzden ana karakter hakkında çok bir şey söyleyemeyeceğim.

Sunuma bakacak olursak oyunda harika bir sinematik anlatım var. Olayları bizzat karakterin gözünden görmek hikayeye bağlanmayı kolaylaştırmış. Bu oyuna RDR 2 tarzı bir sinematik sunum düşünemiyorum. Bu seçim böyle bir oyun için en iyi seçim olmuş bana kalırsa.

Oynanışa gelirsek, oynanışı da yine genel olarak siz seçiyorsunuz ama temel olarak gizlilik ya da aksiyon diyebiliriz. Lakin bütün oynanış bu kadar değil, karakterinize yaptığınız her yeni geliştirme sizi daha da güçlendiriyor ve olaya yaklaşım şeklinizi etkiliyor. Mesela; bir kapı var diyelim bu kapıyı açarsanız hiç bir düşmana gözükmeden direkt mekandan çıkabileceksiniz ama o kapıyı açmak için teknik bilgi seviyenizin 6 olması lazım. Eğer değil ise paşa paşa o düşmanların arasından geçeceksiniz. Bu yönünü beğendim oyunun ne kadar çok karakter gelişimi yaparsanız oynanışta o kadar çok rahat ediyorsunuz. Ayrıca hiç bir rol yapma oyununun beceremediği vuruş hissi olayını harika yapmışlar ama bu maalesef uzak mesafeli silahlar için geçerli, oyunun yakın dövüş hissi berbat havayı yumrukluyormuşsunuz gibi hissettiriyor. 

Yan görevlerden de bahsetmek istiyorum, CD Projekt Red harika bir iş çıkarmış yan görevler açısından. Her birinini ayrı ayrı özenle hazırlandığı bariz ortada. Hepsi ana görev hissi veriyor, her birinin ayrı ayrı sunumları, kendine has olay örgüleri var.

Açık dünyasına gelecek olursak, Night City sokaklarında gezecek tonlarca yer keşfedilecek bir sürü mekan var. NPC yapay zekası daha iyi olsa daha tatmin edici olabilirmiş ama bu haliyle bile dünya canlı olduğunu hissettirebiliyor. 

Sonuç olarak; bu oyun bir GTA 6 değil öyle bir beklenti ile kesinlikle almayın pişman olursunuz, bu bir rol yapma oyunu ve rol yapma mekanikleri içeriyor. Eğer bu türe aşina değilseniz iyi bir giriş olabilir ama ilk başta anlamayabilirsiniz. Bu konuda sıkıntınız olmasın, oyun elinizden tutuyor ve çoğu şeyi size anlatıyor.

+Harika bir senaryo
+Mükemmel karakterler
+Tatmin edici vuruş hissi
+Özgür bir oynanış yapısına sahip olması
+Yan görevleri
+Birbirinden farklı 5 farklı sona sahip olması
+Keanu Reeves

-Rol yapma ögelerinin tatmin edici olmaması 
-Olayları cidden değiştirebiliyormuşuz hissi verememesi 
-Yapay zekanın kötü olması

Puanım: 86/100

Teknik detayları son gelen güncellemeler ile büyük ölçüde düzelttiler, sisteminiz yetiyorsa, paranız varsa hiç düşünmeden almanız gereken harika senaryoya ve sunuma sahip Cyberpunk 2077'yi hiç düşünmeden alın derim. İnternette yazan boş şeylere kulak asmayın oyun cidden güzel parasını sonuna kadar hak ediyor.

Hiç yazmadığımı farkettim. Bu senaryo odaklı oynanışımdı. Sadece belli başlı önemli yan görevleri yaptım ve açık dünyayı çok gezmedim.

It just don't feel right this game needed alot more time I think atleast another year

"Just finished all the quests (other than some gigs and rides) and endings; throwing some thoughts here.

The Night City is massive - we are talking about a 100+ km^2 completely seamless map, maybe half of which is VERY densely packed with people, objects, vehicles, and events. The effort CDPR made to design the layout is astonishing - it's hard to even find 2 streets that look alike and walking in the city indeed feels breathtaking. Love the aesthetics of everything, and there are so many different cars and bikes. Gameplay-wise, there are distinct combat styles you can specialize in (melee, ranged, stealth, quickhacks, etc.), and any one of them can be extremely powerful after you learn the corresponding perks. 

The dialogs, interactions, and quests, main or side, are designed to be some of the most immersive ones among RPGs; several characters have their unique personalities backed up by stories/quests. Texting, phone calls, and the nonexistence of loading screens definitely contribute much to that immersion. Certainly do CDPR know how to write text messages and dialog lines - so well-written/voiced. Also, decisions made earlier in the game can affect what happens later, meaning focusing on the main questline alone and finishing it in 20-30 hrs would be much less interesting. There are several major side questlines to go for and they are just as vivid as the main one. 

That said, the game obviously gives an ""unfinished"" feeling - occasional glitches, sound and performance issues, shitty AI, messy stats calculation and display (especially the clothing mods) and so many locked doors all over the city. Really wish CDPR had more time to work on it. The cyberwares are fine; the arm mods look awesome, but I do hope there were more that could alter the appearance of other body parts. I'm also surprised that auto-piloting is not added as a feature for ordinary cars. C'mon it should be common in 2077.

So I agree with most points made in negative reviews, but the ratings should by no means be undermined by expectations. The pros clearly outshine the cons, even in the game's current form (hopefully large patches coming up can fix the problems). Love it and hate it - exactly my V's feeling towards NC. It's the worst city to live in the 2077 America, but hey, people are still coming no matter what for its endless potentials ;).

[spoiler]PS there are some ugly-ass hats and no options to hide them. Good thing is that armor mods or perks can totally make up for that and you can choose style over functionality w/o a problem.[/spoiler]",True
I like it,True
"There was no way this game could have lived up to the expectation and hype built over the last 8 years by CD Projekt RED, had it even been perfect. It definitely isn’t, but this doesn’t mean it’s not worth playing either. One has just to remember despite the big marketing campaign Cyberpunk 2077 has had, it won’t save your life, solve your emotional problems (if you have any) or provide 500+ hours of constantly [i]breathtaking[/i] experience.

I’m writing this review just before the [i]point of no return[/i] when game warns you moving forward in the story will temporarily deactivate side missions left. As they may have even slightest impact on the final outcome, I’ve decided to finish all of them first. Taking into account how long I’ve played up to this moment, Cyberpunk 2077 will probably take around 150+ hours to complete.

The game runs fine on my four year old PC (i7-6700, GTX 1060 6GB, 32 gigs of RAM). Never had any crash to desktop from the day one. Sometimes I had to quick save and reload to spawn a story NPC to move a quest forward. Occasional NPCs floating mid-air. My V is bald in mirror reflections since the Prologue. That’s it for most noticeable bugs.

I like the main story. It's around 30 hours but together with some of the bigger side quests containing characters from the main plot, it is an OK length for me. Do yourself a favor and don’t focus solely on main missions as you’ll miss much.

Johnny Silverhand with Keanu’s audio is a masterpiece. His stiff way of voice acting works great here, and this is exactly what this kind of protagonist needed.

Nigh City’s atmosphere turned out to be just as I expected. Strong [i]Blade Runner[/i] vibes, especially at night. The vertical design and sounds do the job. It's sad that cars and street NPCs don’t know how to drive/walk around you, but remember it’s not Cities Skylines or a traffic simulator.

The driving model is something different, though. Motorcycle is really the only viable option as it handles much easier. If you prefer cars, I’d recommend using a multitude of fast travel points available throughout the map, and only drive short distances to not rage-quit given how clumsy the driving model is. Of course it gets better the more you grow accustomed to it.

The game overwhelms with the amount of guns, upgrades and character progression systems. I hate the fact that you can accidentally dismantle and [i]iconic[/i] weapon and then never get it back. This is one of the design flaws of this game, hopefully to be revised and updated in future patches which thankfully pour very frequently since release.

You can choose a stealth or open combat approach to almost every mission. Music during fights is intense and increases adrenaline rush. Hostile NPCs’ and police’s behavior is a different matter. To put it mildly – not very best…

As for romance options, there aren’t many, but every player will find a romanceable character for them. Apart from stereotypes incorporated into LGBT characters here, it’s good that such mainstream title is LGBT-inclusive at all. There is also a good balance retained when it comes to depicting love scenes. Not too graphic but definitely suggestive.

All in all, Cyberpunk 2077 is no masterpiece by any means, at least not in its current state. Despite that, I think you won’t be disappointed coming to it with the right mindset. It provides many hours of entertaining experience. Definitely worth checking out, now or later when it undoubtedly gets even better. 7/10",True

"In any industry, this will always happen, as an example like Witcher, that developed by the same company. What they have shown and what they have given was different yet cuts covered only a small portion that didn't have a big impact on the game and it was a success in general, people still can defend the game as the best game since ages. However, for Cyberpunk it's not so. I'm no game developer, yet I can able to understand those features cut so late perhaps at the last delay before gone gold since some of them still can be seen in-game and no, you don't even need to go out of bounds. Just go to one of the train stations, you'll get it.

I've seen lots of news prior release, such as impressive AI that even claims to have random NPCs have a daily routine in open-world, depending on the day/night cycle, backend with unique designs and animations. You were able to chat with them. AI is not for just civilians, they said cops have a warrant system that makes people hunt/patrol on the player, depending on your environment/place the way of their involvement would even change since the producer said he ""details"" law enforcement. And they mentioned you can even bribe some ""corrupt"" officers to avoid this. It's insane that none of those claims were made into it!

Screw routines, NPCs will disappear when out of sight and if they do an action they will do it forever. Time doesn't have an impact on them. They only have 2 to 4 dialogs to speak. If you save them from something, they rarely understand it. They will never try to defend themselves. If you shoot nearby, all they do is crouching and this happens even if they ride a vehicle. If you try to steal their car they will simply let you do it and not even bothered by taking it back. Well, if you crash their car by accident even in the slightest way they cease to move because you simply interrupt their defined route. They will not see you while driving, so expect to get run over by them a lot.

Remember what I've said about cops? Just imagine any game with cops and aim lower because all it does is spawning cops around your vision and all you have to do to ignore them. Move away since they couldn't drive anything to chase you. Bribes? Hunters? Patrols? A huge nope, this is all you have. They will not ask questions or try to arrest you. They simply spawn to shoot, no matter what even in places that no one able to see you commit a crime. No one has detection but you.

You can be a hacker, with getting into people's brains. The way they have shown was unique but it just turned out they have copied and improved what Watch_Dogs does. It's fun, yet it's just too simple and toned down from promises. You can just go into scan and hack from there, no need for any tools or effort but investing in the Intelligence stat. They attempt to make it not-so overpowered by adding cooldown and a ""magic"" bar to prevent you to just sit and press buttons. If you watch old clips/trailers you can see what a beautiful, unique, and immersive UI and gameplay they used to have, yet also has been changed into a simple one instead.

Melee cybernetics toned down as well. Mantis blades had an upgrade that allows people to crawl on the wall for example. Also, they are not even mentioned in any quests in-game, you accidentally run one of those. So it appears to be there are cut missions too. I kinda get why they have removed the crawl feature because it makes movement way easier on level design like this, but why the hell they removed wall running? Mobility feels okay at it's best, people even abusing a cybernetic called Kerenzikov to cancel dodge to another dodge to overcome it.

You had more options like using a spider-robot which is still in-game for only one mission and you are only can interact with it to where it's going to move. It is supposed to have a full impact on your build. Not just classes, life-paths are heavily downgraded as well both in gameplay and quantity. They just change how the opening sequence is instead of at least 4-5 hours as they promised. With some dialog options, sometimes changing how the missions play but not too much.

It's an undeniable fact that this is not an RPG. They made the game linear and short than any other game they have developed so far. In Witcher, how the game is played and how the story goes on can be changed with your actions. Your choices were affecting the world you live in but in Cyberpunk merely nothing changes. Cyberpunk has some RPG elements that slightly better than other open-world action games but way too far to be one.

The funny thing is we comparing it with Witcher, which is supposed to be a less deep experience according to senior level designer. Their interview basically summarizes Witcher series had a basic structure that in a loop while Cyberpunk is meant to have many more layers. It is supposed to be not linear. They also said level design will have layers but it's only can be seen in some quests. Most places are basic outposts that don't have any verticality.

I expected character customization, but they made a simple creation system instead. You can't customize how big is your nose, how your lips are shaped, where are your eyes placed etc. If you have played Saints Row, a less budget game, you can customize those features. Look, I'm not even comparing how weak it is against the Souls series. Also, you supposed to set how your character behaves, what's the childhood idol, basically, you have the freedom to both create how your character looks and what's his background but all you left with a character creation that lacks in everything that even makes you question why we're not just playing with an already-created one.

They also got scammed us with gangs involving with the story/world because I hardly remember most of them present. I couldn't even count them since it's hard to remember something that hardly makes a mark on your experience. Some concepts showed that wild-life and animals are extinct in the universe but mechanical ones replaced them. Yet this is not can be seen in the game. The only wild-life you can see is cats and they are predetermined. It makes sense since they can't even code human AI, what would be the mess if animals are more involved with the world. However, it just makes the game suck at immersion. The trauma team is supposed to play a key role but you can only see them twice.

They also mentioned stuff like a variety of braindance, unseen weather system, more romance/nudity/explicit content, buy/customize properties... the list goes on. But none of them made completely into game, you only can see BDs on quests, weather is just like the other game and even worse than Witchers, you only have 4 romance, 2 different characters to sleep with, 4 joytoys which is hardly making a bunch. Side note, Keanu Reeves made a great job, despite what others said. I liked his performance but sadly the game falls too short, once you get used to having different personalities on your brain, the credits will be rolled.

Back when it's first announced, the game will be out whenever it's ready, but it's not even close to it. They couldn't even handle optimization and hid/banned the footage from early-access review copies to lazily get away from this mess. How they screw up the biggest project they had and if they could manage this game better it would be a masterpiece. But now, it's just another open-world game, which most people already got bored with. 

They kept some of their promises, like the graphics and soundtrack. They said that they will add more features at a time, but the game is beyond saving from their destruction. They should have not announced a release date or better when they delayed it first, they should have delayed it at least around mid-2021 and they should have focused on what they have first aimed for. This is not the game we wanted to play but looks like what we got deserved.",False

"By now everyone knows that this game is a buggy letdown. Regardless, many have said that it's still a decent if uninspired shooter with a good story to carry it that is enjoyable despite the glaring flaws. So, is it worth $60?

No. It is not worth $60. Also, CDPR has done nothing here to [i]earn[/i] your money at all.

To give credit where it is due, the pre-animated dialogue scenes of the game are well done. They do a great job of immersing you in the scene and have a cinematic-like quality to them. The voice acting work is generally done to a high standard and the animations show a great attention to detail. If the game were nothing but a string of these carefully crafted vignettes, it might have been worth purchasing.

Instead, between these enjoyable moments is a wasteland. The city on first glance appears very detailed but when you scratch the surface, you discover there's nothing underneath. Talking to random NPCs walking around gives you a generic, one-size-fits-all response from a pool they all seem to share regardless of context. Committing crimes results in the police appearing out of thin air and shooting at you until you leave, but you can go right back afterward with no issues. The myriad shops you can visit end up being little more than places to dump your excess crap that you accumulate at an irritatingly fast pace. It's basically a glorified loading screen as you run from one story point to the next. The game is also horribly optimized, so unless your rig is a complete monster, be ready for stuttering frame rates the entire time.

Here and there you can find quests or jobs to do on the side, but these offerings are meager at best especially in comparison to the main questline's fleshed out dialogue scenes. Most of the side quests involve simply shooting some guy or sneaking in somewhere and taking something. The few that do involve some dialogue fall short in that the scenes aren't pre-animated. The NPCs don't seem to use any body language in these side conversations so the whole situation lacks the punch of the pre-animated cinematic scenes from the main questline.

The sidequests where you just blast some guys are even worse. The combat is a complete snoozefest. The AI is extremely rudimentary and full of holes. You can funnel a group of guys into a narrow killzone one by one or run right up to each one in turn and kill them while they make no attempt to flee or reposition. In fact, many times when I ran right up to enemies in combat I found they seemed to bug out and stop attacking altogether. There's also the hacking system which seems like it could add some flavor to the combat, but none of the abilities are very interesting and furthermore the AI is so stupid and ammo is so plentiful that hacking never feels like a necessity. There's also a lack of excitement to be had in the skill system. In some games finding interesting and fun builds for your character can yield lots of enjoyment, but not so in Cyberpunk. Almost every single skill is something like ""do 10% more damage when you do [x]"" or ""regenerate [health/stamina] faster when you do [y]"". The most novel new ability you can get by investing skill points is the ability to throw knives. But why do that when you can just use a silenced pistol with stealth perks to make it do 5x as much damage on a headshot when you're hidden? Ammo is much more common than knives after all.

So after all that, do you still feel like you're okay spending $60? I wouldn't judge you for saying yes, but please consider:

What on Earth was CDPR [b]doing[/b]? This game was announced back in 2012 and has been in serious production since at least 2016. They subjected their staff to onerous crunch and delayed the release 3(!) times all the while. And [i]this[/i] is what they have to show for it? This is unacceptable. If CDPR shareholders see profits from this, they will do this again. I regret spending $60 on this game, but even more I regret giving $60 to this development strategy. I rushed into it after it made an okay first impression, telling myself that I was fine with a ""decent if uninspired shooter with a good story"". But when I look at the unending parade of bugs, the horrible optimization, and the empty gameplay I realize I made a mistake. No company that dumps this much labor and time into a game that turns out like this deserves your money.

The only recommendation I have for this game is to avoid it and avoid supporting the industry practices that created it. I regret my purchase.",False

"Just finished the best mission I have ever played on a video game.
Most of the negative reviews are from people who thought this game would be like GTA in future. Nah, it never was.

EDIT: Been reading Steam reviews, you guys are actually morons. Most of you refunded the damn game below 2 hour mark. I got the title drop of this game after 5 hours of ONLY MAIN STORY content. After that game opens up, and I experienced amazing quests so far.
If you have no respect for yourself, at least have some respect for people who worked on the damn game.

Only cons so far are performance and driving for me. Driving does not feel good. I didnt get so far into the game to test the sports cars though, maybe they feel good.

I have a RTX 3070 and I'm playing on ultra. Most of the time its 60 FPS locked but in densed areas it drops down to 40~ FPS. That sucks. That has never happened to me before, and cant think of anything but bad optimization. Hopefully they fix it soon.
There are bugs, but come on, its not even Bethesda level and most of them are silly, not even game breaking. Stop bashing on popular stuff just to make yourselves feel better.

Game is great. It feels damn alive, and I'm a person who doesnt care about atmosphere or any of that kind of sh*t. I strongly recommend everyone to get the game.

"This game is fundamentally broken for an RPG. I guess Red Dead Redemption spoiled me, but this game for all its flash and hype is completely subpar when compared to RDR2. 

In the openings, none of your choices mean anything. You have scenes where there appear to be opportunities to make critical decisions. There are no critical decisions. The opening is on rails no matter what lifepath you choose. I played all three, and I still wound up in Night City with the same person at the end of the same 6 month montage. 

I couldn't make it past that point, by the way. The chip Jackie gives you to start combat training never loaded for me in any playthrough and the game stuck me in a dialogue loop before my first mission started. 

But, in those three lifepaths, you can't actually interact with anything. There's a dancefloor you can't dance on. There's a bar you can't order drinks from. There are cardboard cutout NPCs that have preprogrammed dialogues that happen around you but there are no dialogue options to talk to them, no information they pass. There are a few scattered around that have something to say (a bit of world building) but it all related directly to you and the people in the lifepath that are about to never matter again. 

No NPC has anything to do, or anywhere to go. In RDR2, you can follow NPCs around and they have homes and lives. None of that is realized here. 

It's pretty. It runs well (graphically speaking) on my system. I don't have any of the issues with textures loading late that others complained about, and saw no clipping. The game is very pretty. But it's just that. Pretty.

This game is a complete mess. It has soo many glitches. Avoid this now maybe buy next year after they fix all these issues.,False
"I can't speak to the console ports of the game but my experience with the Steam version has been largely positive.  There have been some minor glitches and graphical bugs, but nothing I'm not accustomed to seeing in most large scale open world games.

For the most part, I find the gameplay fun and the story and side quests to be engaging enough to warrant at least a playthrough.  I have a 2700x and RTX 2070 and can manage to run the game in 1440p with most settings turned up, with the exception of ray tracing which I turned off out of personal preference.",True
"STAY AWAY UNTIL IT'S FIXED or JUST STAY AWAY

- Bad AI (to the level where you can't even enjoy the game, immersion breaking) for example NPC will just walk from point A to Point B without any purpose and then disappear, Cops can't chase you because this game does not even have a basic working AI to chase you, when you commit a crime they will just spawn five feet behind with drones and shoot no matter where you are, fake traffic, traffic AI cant move around parked cars/ obstacles to sum up this game has worse AI than GTA: SA (released 16 years ago).
- Bad Optimization (cant even do 60+ FPS at 1080p on RTX 3060Ti ,Ryzen 3700X, 32GB RAM on Ultra RT-off)
- Bullet sponge enemies
- Terrible Driving mechanics
- Overall a dull open world, nothing to do outside of the scripted Quests.
- Very limited interaction with the game world cant enter most of the buildings.
- Lots and lots of bugs, like in every quest.

Bugs are not the thing to worry here they will be fixed in future patches but there is a big doubt if they can fix other issues. STAY AWAY.",False

"witcher 3 is my favorite game, i love CDPR, and i want CP2077 to be great. the story is, but everything else is lackluster. If you can turn a blind eye to:
-really bad AI both in traffic and general citizens
-a lot of bugs
-the fact that this isnt really that deep of an RPG
-bad stealth mechanics and lackluster combat
Then by all means go for it, the story is amazing from what i've heard, and i'd expect nothing less from CDPR. But if you care about gameplay too, i would give the game another 6 months atleast to mature and get patches.
Theres a great youtube video by ""Crowbcat"" that highlights a lot of the shortcomings of this game.

Im surprised so many people have been able to turn a blind eye to the gameplay part of this game. The 70+% positive reviews on steam definitely doesnt speak for how broken the game currently is. I would definitely recommend that you look further into the game before making a decision and not just basing it off 70% positive reviews. 

Again, i love CDPR but i refuse to sugarcoat when they dont get something right. And a lot of things need to be improved.

"The game is a masterpiece in so many ways. So many reviewers talking about broken promises. I went into this expecting nothing. They were told that there would be features, and things that they claim were never implemented. This is an aspect I care nothing about. Other people are saying that the game is empty, and that there is nothing to do. More quests open up as you earn street credit, so yeah, a level 4 who played 8-10 hours will not have many quests open to them. Another thing, the tutorial of the game is long, and linear; however, once past it the game really opens up. 

For those complaining that the games has the depth of toilet water. Some quests are pretty basic, and some are mind blowing. The game sort of ran with  ""sex sells"", and made it a brand... I'm not saying it's good but it's supposed to be a dystopian world where morality is in decline. If you watch the news in the game, you will note that it's a theme on many levels. Crime is significantly higher in Night City than it is in all of the New United States. 

The bugs... oh my... the bugs. They are aplenty lol. Save often.  I mean, save like your sanity depends on it, because it does :D. A fix for the floating trees was merely updating my graphic card. Albeit, that does not fix the other weird bugs you encounter with the game. Saving helps a lot.

The world is expansive, graphics are beautiful, music is a nod to Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines in my opinion. There is even a club you can dance in, that was all the affirmation I needed lol.

I'm recommending the game because I thought it was really good. Is it messy, yes. I think it's worth the occasional frustration but I am exponentially more patient than most people I know lol.",True
"This game requires.. wait for it...    More polish. 

5/10 at best with the technical issues, graphical glitches and 2 crashes I've had over my hours of gameplay. 

The driving in this game feels a bit off and unresponsive sometimes, the fps drops a lot in dense areas especially while driving. The melee combat is okayish. It's not innovative in the gameplay loop so far.

No NPC AI or Driving AI are big turn off in the immersion in this game. 
You shoot someone in a dark and silent alleyway and police spawns a meter far from you even though nobody saw or reported the crime, drive away and they won't even chase you. 

Park your vehicle in middle of the road and NPCs will just stop at their tracks, no honks or driving around the car. Carjack someone and the npc will just cower, they won't fight back or run away, it's little details like this that make the game more fun and realistic, RDR2, Skyrim, Sleeping Dogs & almost all the GTA games were better in this regard. Fundamentals of this game are flawed, yeah bugs will get fixed but all these stuff need a major overhaul because it literally kills the immersion for me. 

That being said I'm enjoying the story and side quests, they are really good and that's the only reason I'm even playing this game. I'd recommend waiting for bug fixes and maybe a 50% discount atleast because the game isn't worth the full price with all the bugs and features just missing(no subways or trains even though they have built the entire infrastructure?).",False

"I'm going to be frank. When this game works, its a fun and exhilarating experience. I found myself forgetting that this was a game which is a testament to engaging the experience was - WHEN IT WORKED. There are so many bugs that just completely ruined the immersion. dying from falling less than a foot, falling off your bike from a 2 MPH collision while staying on after hitting a wall at 120 MPH, people spawning in walls or props, dialog being randomly unavailable, random T-posing NPCs, the list goes on and on. I also want to mention that this game barely runs at 60 FPS because it for some reason does not fully utilize my GPU. I have a 2060 super, and it just scratches 60% utilization. I really want to give this game a good review, but its hard to do so when CDPR had 9 years to make a game and botched it this bad. I want to reiterate, this game is really good story wise. The game does a phenomenal job developing it's characters and making you really care about them. The voice actors clearly put a lot of effort into the job and it shows. The environment looks absolutely beautiful and really does evoke feelings of a futuristic dystopian America ruled by gangs and mega conglomerates. but all of this good is overshadowed by game breaking bugs and glitches. I would recommend buying the game - just not now. I hope that this game gets the 'No Man's Sky' treatment and all of it's bugs get ironed out.

"Slight spoilers, but none of them are for the story. Just how I think some the in-games systems, but they still might impact your in game choices. You've been warned.

Skipping past the things that I am sure everyone else has already talked about 100 times, like the bugs and what not, since those have a fairly high chance of getting fixed, and I would rather focus on the core experience that is here to stay. I only have a few major complaints about the game, so, lets start with those.

[h1] Cons [/h1]
1st, the character creator was really sub par. It has enough options to get the job done, but is missing a lot from what you would find in other role playing games. You are given just a hand full of options for your facial features, like eyes, nose, and mouth. No offsets, no scaling, no nothing, so if you are expecting to spend a few hours meticulous crafting a characters face, you're going to be let down. The worst part about it is the choices for colors for things like hair and makeup, since you are given a very limited number of colors for both. Going to start to nitpick, the makeup is especially bad, since you have no way to change things like saturation and opacity. I was also a little surprised that there was no option to change the eyes independently of each other. They have tons of cool eye options, that aren't just colors. You got shapes and some cybernetic looking eyes... but if you want them, you have to take two. If you just wanted your right eye to be blue, and have a robotic looking implant in your left, you are SOL. 

2nd, The looter shooter mechanics felt a little out of place to me. Especially on the clothing. If I want to role play as a corpo agent, and all I can find for clothing with good stats is street ware, It gets a awkward. This becomes less of an issue later on, since the time between leveling up gets exponentially longer, and so your clothing can last for longer before becoming useless. As for weapons, its less of an issue. The really nice thing is that if you find a unique weapon, you are able to upgrade it, so it is still able to hit as hard as gear that is a higher level.

3rd, I kind of wish that more was done with the in game relationships. Only did one play though, so only got with one person, but I am going to make the assumption that this applies to all of them. They just don't really feel that great. This one is probably might be specific to the love interest that I chose, but they basically go from normal to super flirty over night. No subtle hints or easing into it, they just fall heads over heels for you, and it's not exactly natural feeling. After that, all they do in the game is sit in an apartment, occasionally text you, and basically stop existing in the games world. I was a little bit disappointed, since after getting myself into a relationship, I managed to stumble upon another potential love interest, and my only options were to cheat, or to tell the person that I am not interested in them. I was hoping for some sort of ""I am already taken"" option, possibly followed up with cute dialog gushing about your partner, and then a ""well, I am happy for you."" But nope, just gotta pretend like they don't exist. I think the worst thing about how the current system is, once you are in a relationship, that's the end of their story. No more quests, tests of faith, ways to screw yourself over, or anything else like that. The dialogue with your partner afterwards is fairly limited, and they immediately stop feeling like a person, and more like a shell. I just always expected that something more would happen, outside of the few texts I mentioned earlier, nothing really did. What makes it even more of a shame is that up until that point, they get tons and tons of character development, and it stops so suddenly.

4th, The way that the game handles choices seems a little empty. Its hard to explain without spoilers, so I won't go super into detail, but outside of a few key examples, the choices you make don't seem to have a lasting impact on the world. They still can change how the quest plays out dramatically, but they just don't seem to have any sort of meaningful lasting impact on the game world, other then pissing off the quest giver and ending their quest line prematurely. No story spoilers, but still sorta ending spoilers.
[spoiler] It gets real clear at the ending of the game, since the ending you get is not really decided by the choices you made, but instead the friends you found along the way. You basically have full control over what happens, and even though the options you are given are technically based on the choices you make, It still left me feeling a little bit empty. Like a lot of the choices I made along the way didn't really matter. I know they did, but they just didn't really feel like it. Again, hard to explain without spoilers [/spoiler]

[h1] Pros [/h1]
1st, The story was great, and really does a good job of hitting you in the feels. I can't think of a character that I thought was under developed, or didn't have clear motives.

2nd, Gunplay and swordplay both feel really good. Game is just really fun in general.

3rd, TONS of character progression. On top of the skills, you also get to mess around with cybernetics, and both are probably equally important in making a build. 

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
The game is a lot of fun, but a little bit rough around the edges. Assuming that the things like the bugs that were present at launch get fixed, I would say its 100% worth the full price, even with the weird quirks and nitpicks I have given.
In the current state of the game while writing the review, I would either say a good choice if you are a fan of similar games and don't mind dealing with some bugs. Still a very enjoyable experience, but it can also be a flawed one.",True

"SPOILER FREE REVIEW:

After 113 hours, I've finished the most anticipated game of the decade. I played as a mantis blade-totting male V with the Nomad lifepath and got the good/best ending with primary attributes being Body/Reflexes/Tech. To say the experience was underwhelming would be the understatement of the century.

Let's get the good things out of the way first:
> Interesting plot: V, a mercenary in the game's dystopian setting of Night City finds themselves chasing a once-in-a-lifetime job- retrieving a biochip (allegedly granting immortality) from the biggest corporation in the city, Arasaka.
> Fantastic visuals: On a technical level, this is one of the best looking games out there, capable of some good looking shots even at lower settings. Amazing lighting and character detail.
> Solid soundtrack: Developer CDPR has always excelled at this so no surprise there.
> Great lore: as Cyberpunk 2020 is an already established franchise, (going back to the late 80s) there's a ton of material for the devs to work with and they definitely seem to have done a decent job in translating the tabletop material to a mainstream RPG format with the world, design, terminology, signature characters, etc... all the while encapsulating it with their own spin on the lore.
> Good characters: the major cast is well realized like Jackie, Rogue, Panam, and Johnny Silverhand himself. Voice delivery and animation work is good for the most part.
> Promotes a variety of playstyles - tanky solo (using the Berserk deck), sneaky netrunner (with a Cyberdeck), hybrid, etc
> The Cyberdeck Quickhack system: Its cool and frankly overpowered, letting you deal with enemies without even entering combat.
> Encourages exploration: with some neat rewards and non-plot related world building for those who take their time to explore.

Mixed on:
> Character customization: feels a tad limited/basic
> Gameplay: In essence it has Fallout like interaction and attribute system + Deus Ex like exploration + Borderlands like combat and skill system - all of it is servicable. Melee is ok, not bad but not good either. The hand-to-hand fight quests were garbage in Witcher 3 and they're even worse here. Combine all the problems the game has, both technical and fundamental, and combat becomes stale very quick.
> V's disconnect from the player and world: due to being strictly first person, the cinematography feels very unimpactful during major moments.
> Lots of augs and skills - but most are extra stat boosts/tweaks (like regain health when reaching certain lower threshold) or borderline pointless stuff (like 2% chance to shock enemies); only augs that were actually gameplay changing were the Double Jump for the legs and Kereznikov/Sandevistan (slows time for a few seconds)
> Side quests: Some of the story side content is quite good (like The Hunt and Sinnerman) but most are forgettable. Though none of them are as complexly designed as the first major side quest about retrieving the spybot from Maelstorm.
> Wonky car handling: its either too heavy or too slippery but some vehicles handle better than others - you get used to it eventually.
> Gear system: Since different gear have different values, your character will end up looking like a complete buffoon if you want to equip the highest armor accessories. Something like Nioh's refashion system would've been great.

Unfortunately the game just drops the ball with regards to everything else:
> Basic open world: Night City is beautiful but shallow - huge and vertical with nothing to do besides run, sneak, interact, jump, attack, drive and pick up scattered loot. Most open world activities (including Gigs) are picked from Ubisoft's book: go here kill this person, clear this hideout, upload this malware, steal this item etc.
> Action and choice: The world does not react or change based on your choices or actions and majority of the decisions you make outside the main plot don't really make a difference to anything.
> Lacking basic enemy variety: thugs/enforcers, netrunners, robots/drones and the occasional cyberpsycho - that's literally it.
> Horrible AI: The worst AI I have seen in a modern video game yet and makes the meh combat a dull endeavor. NPCs have limited behaviours and no basic pathing or collision detection either.
> Tedious crafting system and inventory management - seriously who designed this? Upgrading/crafting gear is very expensive due to needing a ridiculous number of components (often in the higher double digits or hundreds) - even after investing in relevant skills. Disassembling items is a slow process and crafting said components is hair-pulling levels of frustrating; the game really expects me to keep clicking the CRAFT button 500 times to get the 100 components I want?
> Buggy/broken: It's no secret this game is a mess thanks to being in development hell AND being rushed by the upper management. That means this is one of the buggiest games I have played yet, with immersion breaking glitches at every turn - from as harmless as not being able to pick up smaller loot to major, like one of the minibosses being unable to move due to getting stuck in a chair. If I had to describe the situation in one sentence, it'd be ""barely hanging together with duct tape and spit"".
> Misleading marketing: As much as I sympathize with the devs, Cyberpunk 2077 is unfortunately the best example of ""overpromise and underdeliver"" - promised features cut throughout development (like vehicle/apartment customization, non-combat uses for weapons), numerous missing features (no law enforcement tier system, no environmental hazards, no complex AI routines, etc), mechanics that don't work as intended (cops spawn out of thin air instead of in vehicles) and watered down systems (missing lifepath content and toned down verticality). Oh and lying about the state of the game mere weeks before launch.
> Bad optimization: I've seen people across various platforms (and different PC configs) reporting different problems even after patches - for me the game slows to a crawl whenever I look in a mirror (despite rendering mirror res being low and pixelated) or even freezes for a while when taking a picture using the photo mode. Although some of the more pressing issues have been reduced/tweaked (like slightly better overall performance and asset streaming post-patches).

Verdict:
5.5/10. I agree with my V on this one: while I enjoyed my stay in Night City, I don't see myself returning to it anytime soon. The game peaks during the first 6-7 hours which got the most development polish out of the several dozen hours the journey lasts. Not worth buying till it's fixed and when it is, wait for a discount. The pros can't save this one from being painfully mediocre, even though it manages to be engrossing at times. Oh well, hope they finally realize their vision with a sequel.",False
"[h1]""New generation of Open-world adventure"" This game is not what CDPR try to advertise[/h1]

[b]**I'm not gonna complain about bugs, glitches and performance issue because they gonna fix it eventually in the future.**[/b]
My expectation for this game is not that high I'm expect everything that they've said what I can or can't do in this game. I'm playing this game on Hard difficulty and go with Hybrid Handgun/Stealth hack Build. Hard in CDPR games is not hard at all which is understandable because is not what they try to achieve anyway. You can play any style that you want and don't  have to worry about specific build like ""i need to make this build or I'll having a hard with the game"" which is great you can try any build any play style that you want I don't think you gonna having a hard time in this game 
[b]First off let's talk about good things in this game[/b]
- the graphic is great (even tho I don't actually care about graphic in game that much)
- world design is so good, it's so detail each district has unique environment that you can tell the different from each districts that you're in
- main characters model and animation looks really good how they are moving around and talk to you (well w/out the bugs and glitches ofc. i'm try not to talk about it btw lol)
- the story and narrative is really good the writing and the dialogues in this game, it make me immersive in the story. it might be even better than the withcer 3
- photo-mode is probably the great additional to this game 'cause I spend time in photo-mode more than shooting in this game (ok that might be over exaggerated but it's kinda true tho)
- the soundtrack is really good you know what? no! the soundtrack the banger I have to recommend these few track it's so good
[list]
 [*] The Rebel Path
 [*] Scavenger Hunt
 [*] Мусорщики
 [*] Never Fade Away (SAMURAI Cover) - this one is the best song in the game for me
[/list]
- Johnny Silverhand, he might not be the greatest character in video games but he is one of the good thing in this game
- Voice acting is CDPR standard. what is that mean? it's mean the voice acting is great

[b]Now let's talk about what I dislike about this game[/b]
- character creation is really limited 
- the open-world aspect of the game. I know this game is not sand-box open world but if you gonna advertise the game about being immersive in open-world adventure game but you couldn't get this right then that's the problem.
  In the trailer said something like ""Looks is everything in Night City"" and there are some of Dev interview said something about NPCs will comment or react to your looks in Night City Which it never happen to me btw. in 2077 we don't have barber shop and tattoo shop? really? what about cosmetic cyberware? nope we don't get that in this game either (I think they can add this in to the game later but for now this is the problem for me) you can't customize your character after the character creation which is  pretty bullshit to me. NPCs Ai doesn't have a routine they just walking around mindlessly! wow so ""Immersive"" they don't react differently every NPCs will run away or scare when you shoot a gun in the air, no one try to fight back or act different than this. it make the world feel hollow. Car Ai...... i mean you can find a lots of footage on Youtube compare NPCs Ai react to you in this game vs other Open-world games.
- the enemy Ai is too easy. I know i made a point that is good for you to create your build but it doesn't has to be too easy tho. when you stealth the Ai it's so stupid and the hacking mechanic made it even easier. tbf i can't blame them for the game become too easy when I'm stealth because a lot of open-world action games that have stealth as an option most of them never get it right 'cause the main focus is the combat. enemy Ai they don't have any tactic to fight the player. they're main 4 type of enemy in this game, they're 3 Human type and Robot type (or was it an android? i don't remember actually)
Human: Melee, Range, and Netrunner. Robot. Melee and Range is not so different from these type of games although they can quick dash in this game the most interesting one would be netrunner that try to hack you to make your system overheat, to deal with them you need to find them and interrupt the hacking before they can successfully hack you but when Ai is too easy is not hard to deal with
- the combat and gunplay is mediocre it's nothing new which is fine I don't mind it. (it's better than Fallout 4 tho i think? 'cause i remember that I don't like gunplay in that game that much)
- Gangs of Night city. this is the one thing that they promote it as if it's main thing about this game in the main story I don't feel like they matter at all(only voodoo boys has important role in the story but I wish there were more) I don't to get too much into the story but there are so little about them. they have lore and character design and everything for them but never use it to full potential which it really disappointed and I wish when you fight them in combat I wish they fight differently from each gang but nope, they fight the same way in every gang.
- loot system is boring. I'm not an expert or game dev or anything I just feel is boring that's all and I don't have any idea why and how to make it fun to loot
- RPG system oh please... it's kinda RPG i don't know? actually maybe because the skill tree doesn't actually offer anything new. most of them are just increase 10% damage which is fucking boring tbh. I think far cry 3 skill tree better has unique skill to offer to players more than this but yeah I know this is an RPG games not Open-world sand-box
- crafting and upgrade mechanic is really pointless in my playthrough and the game never encourage me to use it. even if you play as techie build is still not that good 'cause you will find a new item that is better than your anyway (I could be wrong with this one I might need to do another play to go full techie build but for now I don't feel like it)
- UI is hard to navigate especially the message window and there are many vehicle for you to buy in this game and it will add to your mission log but it doesn't show picture of a vehicle which is pretty annoying that I have to go through all message window to figure it out which one is the car that I want to buy
- Why can't I buy a Vehicle from anywhere in the map why do I have to go to specific location? this is 2077?
- Life path this is the thing that I really disappoint about this game. First when they show to us that Life path is the Key for multiple playthrough well? is that true? Nope it's the same no matter life path that you choose V's character he/she is the same person doesn't matter which life path you choose. although there are some unique dialogue depends on life path which is feel great when it's there but it doesn't change anything that much in the story
- Dialogue Choice just like life path it doesn't change anything much you just choose for V to say something different form other choice that you have but it doesn't impact or change anything
- ""Your action will impact the world around you"" Yeah, right!
- When defeat the boss in the story there will be an option to spare or kill the boss which [u]most of them[/u] are pointless 'cause you will never see them again in the story
- Your ending choice will available from what Side job have you done which is not bad but I think it choose include the dialogue choice during story to impact ending option as well

Summary: I don't hate this game. this game is a good game (w/out performance issue rn ofc) but it still not the game in trailer that CDPR keep pushing hype with Night City Wire and I don't want to add more thing into the list 'cause it's gonna more nitpicking from me. I would still recommend this game even with many flaws i have with it, wait for the game on sale and more stable than what it is rn.

[h1]So I give this game 2/5 it's a fine game but it's not the greatest [/h1]",True
"It's a 2D Worms game but with a 3D engine, unlike previous Worm games in the past ,objects you see sticking out of the terrain in a map now have physics properties, they can bounc around,crush other worms,explodes,emit poison gas or even throw water around and there's now a seperate water in the game that also has some very nice looking physics to it when it moves around, this water doesn't instant kill your worms like the regular water at the bottom of the map but instead drains 1-3 HP per turn if a worm is submerged in it and everything in it moves slower (both worms and projectiles).
There's also now classes in the game, Scout,Heavy and Scientists (+ the normal worm).
Heavy is the slowest but can take the most abuse
Scout is the fastest,has the highest jumps and can perform some crazy maneuvers while walking thru terrain buuut has the lowest HP and dies the fastest
The Scientist is pretty much a healer, each turn he heals 5hp and that's about it.

However if you don't wanna play with these new classes you can just simply play the Classic mode where every worm is a regular worm like in the older games.


That's pretty much it, everything else is the same, It's the Worms game we all know and love since the 90's.
Only major complaint i have, there's a big lack of enviroments, all you have is Beach,Sewers,Horror and a 4th one which i can't remember the name of atm, while in older Worms games you usully had at least 6 to 10 (sometimes more) enviroments for a map to keep things abit more esteticly different each time.

Bottom line, it's still Worms but with a new makeover and some new fun things added it. Totally worth picking up during a nice sale and playing a few matches with your friends either via the internet or on a single computer.",True
"I really dislike giving this game a thumbs down for now but: it keeps crashing which ruins the immersing. I like the gameplay, graphics and story but - one crash every 30 min (and a reboot to get it running) is just not fun.

"Great game, but not a masterpiece.  They nailed a great world, single player narrative and graphics. They failed on attention to detail, NPC  AI and open world mechanics compared to something like GTA or Read Dead Redemption 2.

Pros:
- Great story
- Great characters
- Great world (design and lore) & environments
- Amazing graphics
- Fun combat with lots of variety

Mediocre:
- Driving

Cons:
- NPC AI (Drivers and Pedestrians) is too simplistic. 
- Side Activities
- Some very interesting side quests appear to end without a satisfying conclusion.",True

Crashed only twice so far,True
"Has great potential just needs bug fixes and better optimization. I don't recommend to get it right now, wait a few months when the game gets more stable to be able to fully enjoy the experience correctly.",False
"PROS:

-Very good characters (mostly)
-Perfect quests 
-Interesting story
-Very good shooting

CONS:

-Still bad optimisation 
-Game still has many bugs
-Almost no completely new mechanics


OVERALL:

Game is very catchy, especially for the fans of this genre. Despite all the controvercy, CDPR succeed making first-person RPG that is way better (I mean on another level) than the ones from other studios. There are technical issues still, of course. But I think they will be fixed as soon as possible.
    For those people who are not excited for this genre and don't like facing various of bugs that ruin the atmosphere, I would recommend not to rush and wait 2-3 months while CDPR is fixing stuff.
    Definitely worth its price and worth playing.",True
"Definitely rough, and full of bugs and little disappointments at first, especially if you are someone who has waited 8 years. But the more you play, the more you will see that this game is in a league of its own. The minor bugs are forgivable and CDPR is rolling hotfixes out quick enough.

After over 100 hours, I can say this game has lived up to its hype.",True
"Overpromised, underdelivered. I did not run into any performance issues, but this game is clearly flawed. It does not feel like an RPG at all. The life paths change nothing, my character is a lame husk with no defining features. The scripted parts are really awesome, but EVERYTHING outside of that is just terrible. The city is beautiful, but ultimately lifeless. The comat is really nothing special. The story seems good, but I would rather wait for updates to actually play it. Needed another year (or two) of development time. I expected a completed, in-depth, branching game from CDPR, but this is clearly not it. Shame...

P.S. I wasn't going to write a review until CDPR Marcin's video. Brushing off the game's issues because they got ""positive reviews on PC"" is unacceptable. This game has SO MANY issues outside of performance on consoles.",False
"I lost my sanity connection with The human world...
CDPR... Thank you.",True
"The legend Crowbcat summarized this whole debacle really well. I went into this game as blind as I could. I expected the quality of CD Projeck's previous work or at least near to it. With all those years of development they must be cooking up a great game huh. But what I got is a barren shell of a game. Without the bugs it's just a subpar open world game with sloppy game play to boot. I felt so empty after I 100%ed this game. ""When it's ready"" my ass. For me the well has been poisoned and I have no further interest in this game. I can't believe they are making multiplayer. The core experience is so underdeveloped to begin with. God help them if they put pay to win shit in there like Cybershark cards. What a shame this all was. 

Judy is best girl though change my mind.",False
"EDIT: I have done my first playthrough. Hotfixes implemented in the game certainly improved its playability for me, but the game still lacks something that's make me go ""woah"" like when I played CDPR previous title, The Witcher III. 
For now, I say the game is good enough. Still, mediocre though. Try to get it at a discounted price.

First Impression:
The current state of the game, I cannot recommend. It has got a lot of bugs, you can search what kind of bug yourself. Many talks of them. If things get better, I will redo my review. 
",True
"50+ hours played and I've maybe had about 10 bugs of which only one was ""game breaking"" aka had to load my latest save which was 2 minutes before that. Just save often and enjoy the game. I play on ultra and play with barely any problems. it's very enjoyable.

Only complaint I have: Fix the damn romances. River is texting me ""Guess you're too busy"" but I can literally do nothing with him. Feels like cut content, such a shame.",True
"This review is for PC version only.
:) This was a very good experience that has it's up and downs but both on their peak. You do fall in love with it but mostly for the idea behind it. Checking every corner reading interesting things you find is good. Overall I liked the game but with %50 approval %50 heartbroken.

Ok I realized my review looked a little hard to read so I decided to completely rewrite it and mixing all my experience after 130+hours. Oh man I feel like this game suffers so much from it's genre only. They just took on the job of telling so much reality in one game. What I mean is it's so hard for developers to just bring seriously fucked up situations of real world and their future versions, like I was expecting topics like drug addiction on kids or vr trapped people, abortions, advanced science and religions etc I won't go too deep. I just can't shake of the feeling that they wanted to implement many things but probably ended up removing all the features we expected. I also felt betrayed on this occasion even though the story is still very much mature, my expectation was to go beyond what was known as a mature story telling. It comes close to the gate though. Well whatever I hope they will get their focus back since they have finally released the game and don't have the hyped players waiting now. I seriously hope this cool things down in the company. I'll just start from whatever I remember and try to be simple. The game is definitely not what's been promised. Your lifepath doesn't effect your gameplay one bit. Imo your first playthrough will be very good, you will always discover new things. But you will always have the constant feeling that you can't shake off which is does this choice really make difference? Should I say this does it affect the gameplay? The answer is no, like in witcher 3 you at least had the choice to be bad geralt or good geralt. From an RPG you expect to be whoever you want right. Well you are V and only V. Your choices will be according to that. From what I see this game's main focus was esthetics, and storytelling. I enjoyed these two a lot. What I meant a few sentences back doesn't mean story is bad.Next is I don't really wanna explain how beautifull the world is, story, characters were great especially characters and woman characters at that. None of them felt standing out from the rest for me they all fit their place and had meaningful not cliche roles. Story did reveal it's plot for me I knew what most of my critical choices in main story outcome would be. So story takes risk free routes a lot. For me I was only surprised at the endings. Unlike side missions were it was really hard to guess the outcome. But side character stories also suffer from cut content. They end like, when you think things are starting to get interesting you just part away from most side quest characters and maybe see their outcome with a text message or from someone else or from somewhere else. That's probably my definite evidence that some big brain people from cdpr or maybe someone that influences cdpr just wanted this game to look like an action story call of duty like game. Nevertheless story was still enjoyable though it's really hard to discern which side missions have high quality writing and are interesting to play and which are not. I was going for %100 so I did it all, almost. If I were to talk about mechanics, what I realized in this game is there are extreme amounts of cut content in this game like I kept telling above it's also here you feel it in the mechanics too and if you do a %100 run like me you will realize it. Like you enter bars everything is so detailed and amazing but it's so dull and uninteractive. You can't play arcade games but they are there animated you can't play billard or if you enter sex bars there are braindance sex booths but they are just empty inside although very detaily made. I heard a rumor about game supposed to be having an underground place how cool does that sound! Other content removal that I know from dev blogs before release are car customizations,  This game's ai except for eh decent combat ai are basically none. Not a functional AI in CYBERPUNK game... I don't know what to say about this. You probably already seen cops teleporting right behind you and disappear after 20-30 meters away from them. They don't chase you at all. I just don't believe they never thought about this and I just know that did think no doubt. Here read this too. Did you know that there is mission in late game where you meet Johnny's friend Kerry who is also rockerboy and with him you do a small job and cops actually chase you in a car?! Like what the hell are you out of your mind my tension rised to 100 I was like finally yes why did they remove this from the beginning when they actually made this to begin with let's gooooo. But the reality was I turned back to the road and back at them to only see that they have already disappeared and the whole thing happened in like 8-9 seconds my tension dropped to 0. The point of this there are tons of things like this that are cut from the game. You are probably asking why. Like those first five secs I did some really extreme manueavers and cops actually did react too properly but there is something that removes these things from the game intentionally. In my humble opinion they just stretched their hands too far and when this got mixed with outside influence they got unlucky this time. It's good to see a company failing while trying to be successfull, because it shows that they are trying to improve things and are in search for the new. Here is a funny thing read this carefully this game was shown in 2013 or something for the first time. Back then the ps4 was the next gen can you think just think for a moment. How can the ps4 version fail so miserably if they started way back then. That didn't make sense to me I think this games current version had a relatively short development time than we think it did. Just a guess tho. I'm sure game will pick it's pace of after a few years and when it enters discounts I hope players will be more welcoming but many might not return, just saying it's not our concern. What can be our concern is that I'm still recommending this game to you. I waited got something that I see potential and I want you to support this game so we all can have way better gaming experiences from cdpr and people who get influenced from cdpr all for the better gaming future!",True
"The most ordinary game I've ever played. Save for the graphics (they're really great at the higher end) and voice acting, everything in the game is just fine.

There's way more bugs than is acceptable for a title of its calibre (even if it's just visual glitches), and I feel CD Projekt Red were way too ambitious originally, and as a result they got themselves lost in their own creation. You see glimpses of greatness, but that's as far as it goes. The world itself just feels uninspired and dull (don't let the pretty lights fool you).

As of now, it is one of gaming's great disappointments, even if you disregard every piece of hype the game garnered before release.

You're certaintly not missing out on anything by not playing Cyberpunk 2077. It's worth a go, but not in its current technical state and asking price - or just how ""okay"" the game is.",False
"Some bugs, only once did I have to reload a save because the scene wouldnt progress, the rest were minor blips. Well worth your money, even at launch.",True
"love the story.  but the bugs are very frustrating.  wait a few months on this one guys.  its really hard for me to post a negative view about this game, i hope CDPR puts in the time to fix this game up to be what they advertised.",False
BEEP BEEP MOTHERFUCKER,True
"I will update this once I get further into the game but honestly right now as is I can't recommend it. Honestly CDPR should have just delayed it again even though crybabies would throw hissyfits again the game could have used another delay because as is it just suffered from a rushed launch with a myriad of bugs and glitches ranging from texture pop-ins to framedrops to physics bugs like items clipping through the world of characters spacing out. The game on High/Ultra simply does not look fantastic as well and the texture pop-in problems exacerbate this feeling that it does not look good. Now a big patch is rumored to be dropping soon but until then these problems are just a huge turnoff for me personally even though I'm running it better than a lot of people are with hardly any framedrops and with a good enough fps where it does not really bother me.

First Impressions:
Let's start of with the character creation, for an RPG it's really really underwhelming and I severely hope that either mods or a later update will improve this because it was a massive turnoff for me personally. Maybe I'm spoiled with modded Skyrim and normal Dark Souls character creation but right now it feels subpar. Baldur's Gate 3 to me had way better character creation. Let's start off with the fact that you can only pick 1 voice for female and 1 voice for male although you can pick both for you character but this means they went the Fallout 4 route where there are only really 2 voices available which is a shame. Then we go to the skin colors, a bit lackluster as well, couldn't really find a decent white skin tone in there and the closest one I found to a regular white skin tone gave me more of an asian/latino vibe. Haircolors are severely lackluster, I get that this is supposed to be a futuristic game but can we get some normal hair colors in here and not just SJW neon pink/blue/green hair colors? The most normal one felt like the brown hair, didn't have blonde, because even black hair had some weird green stuff in it which is a shame. Furthermore we can't tweak the build of our character and adjust their musclemass or height which is a shame as well. Makeup and tattoo options were also really lackluster again where I was not able to go with something more classy in terms of makeup and instead only go with crazy colors, it also did not have an opacity slider for it like most other RPG's have and the tattoos did not really do it for me either. All in all I really disliked the character creation and because that plays a large part for me in RPG's, I normally put a lot of time and effort into character creation it already was a huge turnoff for me.

Now the combat and controls, it felt decent, not great but not terribad as well. I did expect more of a DOOM Eternal like feeling where it would feel and handle really well with great gunplay but it did not deliver. To me personally it felt just a bit better than a Fallout game. Again maybe I got spoiled by games like DOOM, Battlefield and CS:GO but it just did not feel that great but again it did not feel terrible either.

And again I already talked about the visuals and bugs which are just not up to snuff for me. I did not play much of the game yet so I can't say much of the content of the game but the first impressions were a huge letdown for me and personally I don't feel like it's GOTY material yet. Maybe the game will be more enjoyable when I get further into it but right now I'm not gonna play it until they at least patched it into a stable state where it feels and looks better and with a bit of luck there will be mods out by then that improve character creation as well. I also have to say I honestly don't care for the setting as well, normally I'm more of a fantasy/dark fantasy type of guy and dislike sci-fi but if the game is good enough I can put myself past that and still enjoy the game like I did with ""Alien: Isolation"" but this time around the game is not good enough for me to like it and since the setting already doesn't interest me I don't find it hard to put the game down for a while.",False
"I did not intend on buying Cyberpunk2077, however, I decided to buy it a few hours before release. Although, there are quite a few bugs, there was nothing groundbreaking about them that made the game unplayable. I enjoyed playing the game and the story, overall satisfied. It could have been better. The list of things I have seen that should have been in the game would have been worth waiting for. It is quite a shame that people wanted the game to rush and be released. I think over the next year or two with the correct patches and content being released would most definitely make the game worth playing. A lot of people should wait for optimisation and a bit more time for the game to be refined.",True
"I don't know what is the bigger disaster. This game or covid. The game just flatout doesn't work the way it's supposed to. Forget the frames, bugs or texture pop-in. The driving mechanics are horrible and the characters are boring. The silver lining is the gunplay and leveling system. This is the last time I'll ever pre-order something.",False
"It's hilariously boring. After one century of development time this game is nothing more than a mediocre combination of fallout, deus ex and gta.",False
"Sleep on it. It's buggy, it's missing a lot of basic 'genre-standard' and quality of life features. I'm still playing it and enjoying it somewhat, but if you're worried about a missing or lackluster feature, take a look.

There's a lot to go over here, and a lot of it may be subjective; to those who might think I sound entitled, remember how much this game was hyped up by its creators and what many other simpler and smaller games do much, much better. I didn't have high expectations going in, but I did expect the game would at least compare to GTA, RDR 2, Skyrim, Deus Ex and other big-name titles after The Witcher 3. It's not a good sign if a game's best features are at best 'decent' and the rest mediocre or forgettable.

THE BAD:
• Bugs and poor performance. Mileage will vary heavily here.

• The role-playing systems in the game are fairly shallow, as are the impacts of your dialogue choices. Your leveling choices don't really impact much in the narrative besides sometimes giving a different optional dialogue choice that lets you ask characters different questions. Don't go into this expecting Fallout: New Vegas dialogue; most of the skill-related dialogue options usually have the same result as other choices. 
• Dialogue in general is stiff and you often only get a couple of options, usually including: 'progress the conversation', 'give me information' or 'what is your opinion on [topic at hand]', making it feel a LOT like Fallout 4. Many people have noted that dialogue choices have the same outcome when re-loading to pick a different option to see what happens. 

• Levels are fairly linear. Nothing much else to say about that - you go in, you come out.

• There is crafting, but from how much stuff you regularly pick up you will never need to use it. I had ~50 medkits and tons of guns before I was even done with the prologue.

• There isn't much to do besides exploring the city. Your options are: Shop for gear, boxing, racing (I don't know if this is actually a feature), hiring sex workers, four(?) types of simple missions offered by fixers, buying specific cars from fixers, and killing criminals for the police for bounty money. Don't expect to hang out with buddies, play cards (unless I'm missing it, no Cyber-Gwent, sorry), play any sports/parlor games, use braindances or much else. [b]You won't be blown away here.[/b] 

• The character creator isn't terrible, but isn't great. I found no way to change my body shape/size and many categories (tattoos for example) are limited. There are no RGB sliders or Bethesda-esque shape sliders. The creator's layout is also fairly clunky. [b]You can't change your looks once you've made your character[/b]. There are [b]NO[/b] plastic surgeons, tattoo parlors, or barber shops to go to if you don't like what you made. 
• [b]The character creator and inventory are not lit well. Expect your character to look different from what you thought you made.[/b]

• Customization is... not there. Guns can only take silencers, scopes, and stat-mods, nothing like grips or magazines. You can't change the appearance of your weapons or clothing and must buy both as-is if you can find any in colors you like. [b]There is no vehicle customization[/b], and you must buy or steal vehicles that look the way you want. Many cars for sale from fixers (the only way to buy them) are in set colors/styles so you might not find any you like.

• The police system is terrible. Cops will [b]instantly[/b] spawn within 15-20 feet of you if you commit a crime and immediately start shooting; I wish I was exaggerating, but I'm not. I unloaded on a crowd with a machine gun to test this and I was killed in under 6 seconds by 10-15 police that all spawned in all around me almost immediately - [b]again, I wish I was exaggerating, but I timed it.[/b] Don't expect to get in car or foot chases either; it's [b]extremely easy[/b] to lose them.

• No vehicular combat, and vehicles take basically no damage if you ram into them or ram your own into other things. You can't shoot from cars or bikes and there is basically no effect if you ram into a wall at top speed. I've repeatedly smashed into cars and barriers going 190km/h on a motorcycle and [b]at best[/b] my character jerks slightly and I come to a clean stop. [b]All of the armed vehicular combat in this game is in scripted on-rails sequences.[/b]

• Stealth is fairly bland and lackluster compared to how it was made out to be. It's almost entirely line-of-sight based, with a short timer before enemies see you if you're in the open for too long. Don't expect Dishonored or Deus Ex: HR/MD level stealth mechanics. Many times I've just walked or run up behind enemies to perform takedowns and I'm not really convinced they hear much short of gunfire.

• Hacking isn't nearly as impactful or in-depth as trailers and gameplay videos made it seem, making netrunner builds forgettable. There isn't much incentive to use it outside of the story missions and hacking computers usually just lets you control cameras or harvest money/crafting parts. Hacking computers is done via a simple minigame with little thought or strategy to it and hacking peoples' cyberware is basically a 'magic' system with recharging RAM (mana) and a dozen or so different hacks (spells). 

• Expect NPCs to be less engaging than that of GTA and nowhere near Skyrim or other big-name open world games. They feel like set pieces and often spawn in/out around you at random. [b]Civilian NPCs WILL NOT ATTACK YOU if you commit crimes,[/b] despite a major lore theme being that almost everyone is armed. You will find them cowering in place if a gunfight happens nearby, and they usually won't leave this state.
• NPC vehicles are the same, and it's possible to halt traffic by just parking your car in the road. They [b]will not drive around it[/b]. This is a minor nitpick for the most part but is still... lame.

• Graphical settings don't seem to do a whole lot, and the game lacks an option to tone down bloom and indoor/outdoor lighting transitions - [b]DON'T drive full speed out of tunnels[/b], you will often ram into things you didn't see due to the [i]blinding[/i] light at the opening.

These next two involve spoilers regarding characters:
• [spoiler]Jackie, Dexter and T-Bug all die in the prologue.[/spoiler] There is no way to change this that I know of. The fact that many characters were been built up so much by trailers makes their fates and the fates of others in the game jarring or disappointing. You may be left wondering ""What was the point of all that build-up?"" at times.

• BIG SPOILER: [spoiler]Johnny Silverhand is an a**hole, and not a likable one. It may just be my tastes but he often acts like a one-dimensional, angry manchild at many points, disregarding things you say to him and making snide comments about you or others fairly often. For being a pivotal character, he's a lot harder to like than the majority, big or small, evil or good. I wound up loathing when he'd appear as it just feels like an interruption most of the time. Don't get me wrong, I love Keanu in most stuff he's in, but Silverhand doesn't come off as well-written or engaging.[/spoiler]

THE GOOD:
• Mostly all audio is great; I think this is where the game shines most.
• Visuals are pretty, even on low settings, which you'll probably be playing on without a VERY beefy rig. 
• [b]YOU CAN IMPROVE YOUR GEAR.[/b] I have seen MANY complaints about a lack of this but you can improve stats of items in the crafting menu.
• Combat is OK. It's satisfying enough seeking out fights in the game.
• Some genuinely good missions, if tedious or eye-rolling at times.

"I definitely relate heavily with the game, as I too am wasted potential... Take my advice, pretend the game got delayed for another year and wait.

Seriously. I could write down pages and pages of hilarious bugs I've personally seen, not to mention the dozens and dozens of videos I've watched online. Some are just sad too,  like missing weapon icons and blank item names which show how rushed the game was in the end.

 These hopefully will be patched over time, but the sad thing is even then the game might just be 'decent'. Some core mechanics and gameplay systems are just so broken/barebones, it will take a miracle to fix in my opinion. Horrendus AI, mediocre stealth, gangs / police interactions exist in the simplest form imaginable, etc. It's just so disappointing when comparing them to much older games like RDR2. 

Of course, it's not all bad. Night city is master crafted and a beautiful game world, and I personally think the characters are interesting (some may disagree). The gun play isn't amazing, but it's solid with cool weapons and attachments. The perk system is fun and offers a lot of unique choices. The story choices don't super matter, but there are some really cool ones that have impact later on.

I just hope CDPR can some how replicate what Hello Games did with No Man's Sky, and down the line we'll get something similar to the Witcher 3.",False

"If you thought Fallout 4 was a ""masterpiece"" of RPG storytelling then you'll love Cyberpunk 2077 once it is fixed for it contributes little to the genre in such a remarkably unremarkable way.

Phrased more concretely, this is a AAA production featuring Keanu Reeves with AA tonality.

Once the glitches are fixed its charm will be replaced with a overdone and cliched plot that weighs one's mortality with one's values but the emphasis of this dilemma is not written well enough or developed at all until the third act.

It is plagued by a myriad of bugs (a lot more than I though I would have), from muted sounds, to crackling sound, to characters talking on top of eachother on emotional moments. Tposing characters everywhere, the car spawning below the ground, and today with the new patch it got even worse. 

Frame drops, enemies randomly spawning in front of me in a fight and crashes everywhere that I need to restart the game. Unfortunately this game will be more satisfying a year from now it seems.",False
"I have not finished the game yet. Up to this point the game is amazing. If you liked the Witcher 3, you know what to expect.

Graphics are great, world building is great, main story is at this point engaging and interesting, while countless side missions, some of them short, others hours long provide a vast amount of content.

52h in and I'm maybe 1/3 through the main mission and the majority of the map is still riddled with unsolved quests and activities for side missions.

For the gameplay, the shooter aspect is good, stealth is good, but both are not very good. Combined with cyberops they are still fun.
Yes there are glitches, primarily physical anomalies, which happen rarely, if not provoked, and do not lessen the fun.
Loot is weird, like in W3, it's engaging but overall feels not well thought out.
For the autogenerated peeps walking in the streets, they serve their purpose as environment. Sure GTA5 and RDR2 have more realistic behaving auto generated characters filling the streets, but not dozens and dozens at the same time. It's ok.

Technical wise everything is running fine and I haven't encountered a crash yet.",True
"I had originally started writing a much longer Steam review for Cyberpunk 2077, but due to the 8000 character limit, I didn't get even halfway through, so I will condense it into some finer points.

Cyberpunk has a few problems. The biggest to me is the lack of content that was promised by developers but never made it into the final game. It's well documented in the development process just how much didn't make the cut and was removed before release. I hope they will reintroduce some of these features in later updates. The AI is hugely problematic and really breaks immersion. Crowds of NPCs will crouch and cower when you commit a crime near them, all doing identical animations, police spawn in infinitely near you out of nowhere, but don't follow or chase you when you flee the scene, the AI is truly a mess. Much of the games content feels meaningless, life paths have no effect on what actually happens in the story and merely offers you a different prologue or some lines in conversation that, again, have no impact on the actual game. Loot has similar issues where for you find yourself wearing a skirt, power scouter and a bandana because they offer 10 points more armour than the kevlar vest you've been wearing for the last 3 hours. This applies to weapons too and makes the loot system largely redundant, as you're swapping out weapons for a tiny numerical increase. Lastly I wanted to touch on optimisation. Although I personally didn't have many issues with performance, I did experience bugs, but all of them were fixed with 

Cyberpunk 2077 isn't all bad. I've seen lots of people complain about the RPG elements but I think these claims are baseless. The skill tree offers around 240 nodes for you to spec into, changing abilities or giving increases to different stats. A large number of choices in how you spec and the cybernetics will influence how all combat is handled. There are skill checks in Cyberpunk and whilst mostly they aren't influential to the game itself, your attributes are used in the world and dialogue too. Strength can be used to open doors or intimidate people, intelligence gives you more options in hacking, technical ability will allow you to deactivate cameras or pick locks. The visuals are absolutely stunning in this game, even in lower settings, the city looks amazing and feels amazing. The wonky AI can detract from the immersion as I previously said but judging the game solely on how it looks, it really feels triple A. The art design is right on the mark with a blend of eastern and western themes put on top of a city that really feels like a dystopian mega-city. The world-building feels truly handcrafted as little details are scattered throughout from the edges of the wastelands to the bustle of the inner city skyscrapers. The voice acting is also great throughout with main characters being well handled if not a little cliche in places, but I think it's fitting and just furthers the setting that they are in. The story feels compelling and seeing characters react to your plight, with the excellent voice acting, really cements the experience for me.

Side missions feature interesting characters, that feel easy to connect with and have interesting missions and stories. The gigs and scanner missions are more repetitive without as much narrative but as long as you don't leave them all to the very end like I did you won't mind them too much. The game has multiple endings, some of which can be influenced by your actions during the main game and whilst they are mostly somewhat depressing, they do tie off loose ends and feel weighty to the story.

This game suffered from people expecting the greatest video game of all time. It tries to do too much of everything and it suffers for it with everything being on a scale from just fine to excellent. What it does well, it does really well, what it doesn't do so well, requires further polish and additional content which CDPR do seem to want to work on and fix. All in all Cyberpunk is still a good game, the hype for this game was far too big for it's own good and between the devs over-promising and the higher ups forcing the game out before it's ready, it never stood a chance in the public eye. That doesn't absolve it of it's shortcomings but it does explain them.",True

It being either [i]nuclear massive bugs[/i], cops matrix spawns, a few overpowered ""one hit"" lightning enemies, money transactions delayed & money disappeared glitch, voice acting laughable, Keanu Reeves looking like plastic action figure, car just stops going forward, invisible stuck-in walls, can't shoot out of car/bikes, same NPC duplicated spawned, no random events, a bunch of fake glitched cars, 10 received calls at the same time, cars being in general donkey and a bunch of other minor bugs.

At the same time, this game is having an [b]identity crises.[/b] It could have been the new future GTA, focusing on a singleplayer story then release a fun and alive multiplayer world, earning billions. Or it could become the new Skyrim, an RPG story rich game that took the world by storm with people still playing in huge numbers today, with huge mods and an engaged community. This game basically tried to do a bit of both, however not knowing what it wanted to be, ended up being a weird mix of both. 

On one side, you have no reason at all to explore. Which gives you no reason to randomly talk to people, get quests, do random events, do RPG stuff, making the world not feel alive. Being dead, which destroys immersion, creativity, mods and engagement. But then, on the other side having no sandbox world elements, there are no driveable flying cars, no helicopters, no flying at all. Having no other vehicles than cars & bikes, at the same time having bad driving which just feels fake. 

[b]In conclusion what we are left with:[/b]
A open world, huge, game that is only being carried by a story. Being incredibly weight down by everything else in the game. Making the main story incredibly rushed, which leads to no engagement in everything else this game has to offer. Imagine Skyrim only being the main story line, no 256 other quests, guilds, random events and other story lines. 

This could have been such an amazing game, a true ""Game of the Year"". Could have been the next Skyrim, the next GTA, the next Witcher 3. Could have been itself, a true Cyberpunk 2077.

But is now, an [u]unfished and rushed, overly hyped game, having an identity crises.[/u]

"It's just not that compelling for the asking price.

Dialogue is well written, but the plot itself is pretty dull so far, don't feel like any dialogue choices I'm making are having a perceptible impact on the game. The characters are likeable and distinct from one another, so that's good. The open-world aspect seems like set-dressing since very little of it seems to be meaningfully interactive. 

At least on hard difficulty, the combat is a clunky mess of damage sponges that don't pose much of a threat. It's reminding me a lot of Fallout 3 combat, and that's definitely not a good thing. There are options for stealth/quickhacking but they don't really feel necessary when shooting people in the face works extremely well.

So far gear is boring. It's a bizarre choice to have clothing be strictly-better on armour values. If you want to not turn into a puddle in combat you'll need to equip the 130 armour fedora and cargo shorts, sorry. The perks seem kind of cool until you realise they're interacting with a combat system that's baseline boring and has you up against relatively braindead AI. 

To top it off, the framerate is all over the place and the graphics presets don't seem to adjust the fact that performance is erratic despite GPU utilisation being inexplicably low.

Once the main story and the side quests (which there aren't that many!) are complete, all you're left with is small ""gigs"" which are essentially generic fetch quests.

During the marketing of Cyberpunk, we were promised (and saw) a plethora of features that are no where to be seen at launch... Substantial/significant life paths, a breathing living world with AI that reacts to players, dynamic weather systems and a city with a gritty futuristic soul. The open world game has a lot of objective markers but, beyond the main and side stories, the formula gets old and the shallowness kicks in pretty quickly and besides car purchases it’s hard to find anything worth working towards, interacting with or immersing yourself in.

"In an effort to write a Steam review for every game that has demanded my attention (and money), even if only for a fleeting moment in time... it's time for Cyberpunk 2077 to take the stage. So without further ado, let's get the party started.

My experience with this game has been phenomenal. I'm plenty hours in at the time of writing this review and it still continues to impress me at every turn. There are some really fresh ideas and mechanics at play here. The story, pacing, game world and lore are all super immersive. The eye candy is delicious (RTX on psycho setting and DLSS on quality). The music is consistently on point, as in really good. The RPG layers run deep. The gunplay feels rock solid. The controls and movement are responsive (both KBM and XB controller). 

Thankfully I have had no crashes or serious bugs to date, just a few minor bugs that are not even worth mentioning - and which I believe were fixed with Hotfix 1.04 (the latest update at the time of updating this review is Hotfix 1.06). The only real complaint I have is that the HDR implementation is really bad. I'm playing without HDR as a result, as the colours are too washed out with it on. I hope this will be fixed in a future patch. The ray tracing is top dollar though, so that kinda makes up for the poor HDR (for now). I'm getting 45-62 frames with this setup (9700k/2080Ti/1440p/RTX on psycho/ DLSS on quality) but even when FPS dips below 55, it's still really smooth. I tested with and without G-Sync, and both are smooth. I think the game is very well optimised, even at launch, so I expect it to only get better.

CP2077 is a masterpiece in my books, at least where I am in the story. Right now it's difficult for me to fault this game other than the HDR implementation, it has lived up to every expectation I had - and my expectations were high. It gets a solid 8/10 at this point. I will still be sinking plenty hours into Night City and its Cyberpunk world, and will update my final rating once I'm done with my Nomad run. Then there's the Corp and Street Kid runs to complete.. lots of fun still to be had.

5 = Average
4 = Below average

"Игра, которую ждал с первого трейлера, игра, которая решила воплотить любимый жанр, в неонпанковых декорациях, в которой одну из гланых ролей играет Киано, как же все идеально было на бумаге, трагедия в реальности.

-Мир 
Найтсити, он прекрасный, но однотипный. Город выглядит прекрасно, а то как обыграна разница китайского и японского района города, просто выше всяхик похвал, но хочется сразу отметить, что за этой красотой стоит однотипные магазины, рекламы, вывески и другие элементы помещений, который тебя заинтересовуют, но зайти туда не дают, кол-во стрипух, как пример - запредельной, а зайти можно от силы в 6(которые нашел), так-же с магазинами одежды. Вывеска влечет, а взаимодействовать нельзя. 
Так-же сам город, очень скуден на иммитацию жизни в нем, может от силы наберется 4 разных активности, но все по своей сути остаются одним и тем-же расследованием ментов или перестрелкой. За пределами найтсити предельно скучная свалка и пустыня, которую наполнить чем-то интересным или интересными вещами, явно времени не хватило, как и промышленный район в верху карты. 

-Билды и аугментации
Я проходил на самой высокой сложности по этому буду говорить за свой экспириенс.
Нетраннер - скучно и бесполезно. 
Рембо с катаной или кулаками - без замедления не успеваешь подходить, а боссы умирают в станлоке.
Рембо с обычным оружием - КРИТ КРИТ КРИТ ВАНШОТ ВАНШОТ ВАНШОТ 
Рембо с смарт-оружием - режим обычного оружия для консольшиков которые не умеют целится или девочек. 
Инженер - Джихадист.
Стелс - он кастрирован и просто не работает.
Проходя в билде, с прокачанными винтовками, катаной и инженерией, я всех ваншотил, кроме некоторых боссов и оверлвл врагов, а тех кто в милии прибегали убивал катаной, не давая выйти из станлока. 
По итогу я просто бегал и срелял по головам с присяда, словно в Нью Вегас играю, лел.

Машины. 
Управление, как в играх Юбисофт - утюги или масло на сковородке. 

Оружие,
Стрельба скучная и не чувствая от слова вообще, разве что ГРАД, хоть как-то чувствуется, что действительно увесистая и мощная снайперская винтовка. 

Сайд-квесты.
Большая часть, как и в ведьмаке - ""принеси, подай, иди нахуй, не мещай""
Но сайды персонажей и некоторые случайные встречи, крайне интересные и приятные.
Активности по городу, однотипны и тоже скучны. 

Основной сюжет.
Увидев надпись, что обратного пути нет, я подумал, что просто мир перейдет в другую фазу и все, а игра продолжится, но нет это был последний квест, если бы я не проходил побочки, то времени добраться до него у меня заняло, часа 4 наверно, скипая диалоги офк.  это просто смешно, особенно с учетом длительности кампании ведьмака, даже если взять в сравнение длс. 

Аугментации
Все приятно, но часть непонятно откуда брать, кроме вендеров, а вторая часть открывается по почти бесполезной ветки талантов. Так-же раздражает, что Билд слетает, если поменять имплант. 

Баба с членом или Член1 - Член2
Я из интереса создал нонбинарную членодевку. Но как оказалось это вообще не роляет, все обращаются ко мне как к чике или Мисс Ви, если персонаж голый, то смотря на ноге, на нем трусы, будто у меня и нет члена, а сам член виден только в инвентаре. Да вы верно поняли, что в постельных сценах его нет. 
Ну и да, постельные сцены не зависимо трахатся с мужчиной или женщиной - одинаковы, кроме сюжетных персонажей. 

По итогу игра оставила скорее положительные эмоции, но после такой быстрой концовки, я сидел в ступоре и не понимал, что даже сказать, потому что ожидал, что будет продолжение сюжета исходя из моих выборов ответа под конец. Игра явно сырая, в ней куча багов, проблемы с механиками стрельбы, езды и балансом веток талантов, а так-же производительностью, но присутствует красивейший город, интересный основной сюжет, а так-же Киано говорящий ...Impressive Cock. Это хорошая игра, но ее проблемы, короткая сюжетная компания, однотипные сайды и активности, баланс веток талантов, скудный мозг у врагов и вечный менеджемент говна из сумки, убивает все ее плюсы.

"[h1]An Overhyped Disappointment[/h1]

 ""Companies can not be our friends""

  Over the last 5 years, CD projekt has gained the trust and love of its consumers. Hype was built on and on after Keanu Reeves' ""Breathtaking"" moment. Instead of staying silent and  developing the game to its best they just presented the game as ""The Next Grand Thef Auto with RPG"". The game severly lacks so many elements like RPG, customization, design preferances, optimization. The world looks great but it feels so emotionless because of bugs(texture, sound, quest, dialog) glitches etc. Bugs and glitches destroys the immersion and experience most of the time. I thought this game could be the next New Vegas. Turned out it wasn't even a decent RPG after all. Choices you make does not affect the story progress if not little and sometimes the choices in some quests are the exact same answer but with different way of expressing. Some design preferances like V's sleeping style and showering with her clothes on are hilarious. Vehicles in the game do not respond to crashes or sometimes cars just bounces over other vehicles or citizens. Customization is so shallow. You can't change your body type and the game force you to wear the clothes you don't want to because of clothes' good ""stats"". You can upgrade your favourite clothes and weapons but after some time in game you will find clothes and weapons which have way better ""stats"". I did everything in the game yet I don't even have enough money to buy all the cyberware or cars. At this point I had to exploit the system in order to have more money. Police system are dumb. I shot a civilian in the middle of nowhere and two polices spawned right behind me. It becomes so annoying sometimes.

CD Projekt just shot itself on the foot with shady marketing and releasing an unfinished game.

"So I am not usually one to write reviews; but I think this is the one time I need to. I will try keep this as objective as possible, as someone who tried to enjoy the game even in its well-known buggy state.

The good:
 - Artistically, there is a lot of heart put into the level design. Places feel different and interesting.
 - The combat can feel pretty good. When you turn a blind eye to the bugs, going around as this elite cyber-ninja or runner is pretty cool
- I had a lot of fun with the open world. I cleared all the side quests which kept me this busy. Did that before touching most of the main quest.
- Story has some very interesting points in it. Liked where it was going.

The bad:
- So many bugs. The experience is rather immersion breaking. Like a game with the feel of a B-rated movie? Then you will be entertained for hours. Expecting a new gen experience? Not yet.
- This game is not just bugged, its broken. 64 hours in and my game has hard locked into not being able to tell when a day has passed and all quests have stopped working for me except one which I never wanted to tackle.
- Performance is rough. It needs a lot of polish.
- A cluster of systems have been implemented which are at the quality of an intern's project. I feel for the developer's who crunched for this. I understand how much they pushed to make the game happen. However, its very evident as you play that systems were never finished or were rushed to the point of absurdity.

Recommendation: Wait until this gets fixed. This game is, in its current state, is more of slice of what the game could be. In terms of software development, the basics are there; but it lacks the features and polish that would make it production grade. Further, some bugs are game breaking and will leave your save dead in the water.

There are 5 stats to choose from, and each of them have at least 2 big skill trees, so for example even playing stealthy has different ways to build your stealth toon.

The game is fine, but not that promising as some people hoped, and I doubt devs can please them besides fixing bugs.... but those stats and their builds are like a candy store. Go full focus on balancing these, devs, or even add a synergy system, Diablo II style! :) In the end, gameplay is all that counts.",True

As far as I can tell, there is no way you can customize your character later on in the game, nor can you ""unlock"" or obtain any other cosmetics for your character other than the clothing/armor. 

When I played The Witcher 3 one of the biggest things that stood out to me were the NPCs. I really liked the amount of unique dialogue and range of voice acting in certain non-essential NPCs like town guards and peasants which made the environment feel more ""alive"". I was looking forward to that feeling in Cyberpunk 2077 only to be let down by NPCs that you cannot interact with at all and extremely buggy AIs. 

And of course the gameplay and environment has been extremely buggy. I've had T poses to random floating objects and the infamous clipping issues as many others have had. I would have thought by now those would have gotten worked out with the amount of delays and testing that has been done, but nothing can be perfect.

I wish I could return this game honestly. Most of the 13 hours that I have played were unkowingly leaving the launcher open on my desktop. That being said it is over the 2 hour threshold Steam allows for returns.  If CDPR fixes some of these bugs and addresses the community concerns I'll consider revisiting the game. Until then I am planning on continuing to try with customer support and letting Cyberpunk collect some dust.",False
"Despite all my respect to CDPR I can't recommend this ""RPG"" at its AAA premium price and PR with a lot of dev promises not delivered on release at all and also a myriad of bugs and poorly designed features. I've beat the game at a casual pace in just 1 week, can't believe this was decade in the making by creators of The Witcher 3. Driving is worse than in GTA Vice City, there are barely ANY choices and consequences, 0 replayability, items and their stats are broken, crafting almost doesn't exist at all. This game compared to The Witcher 3 is like Outer Worlds compared to New Vegas, a shallow attempt to follow up on a legendary title.",False
"Wait a year and then come back, right now this game is a mess",False
"I don't normally write reviews, but I feel I had to write this one specifically, in order to enlighten the gamers that have not bought this game and know the whole situation about it. I will keep it as spoiler free as possible, I hope.
Let's start with saying that I have 48 hours on the game and that tells something.

The core-gameplay of the game is enjoyable. The city looks fascinating and CDPR tried to make the game truly feel alive inside the streets of night city or on other parts of the game as much as possible.
The Level System aswell as the skill perk system reminds me of skyrim, but in a good way, since you can have multiple builds, that (trust me) are really fun to create (not that I mean that skyrim's character building system was bad :P).
The game also has a variety of vehicles, that you need to buy and afterwards are able to drive with them around.
Not to say that you can do lots of secondary missions to gain money and level up your character while creating your preferred build.
Also forgot to mention: the cyberpunk soundtracks are really good!

Some of the good parts of the game sound nice, right?

Let's start now with the reasons of ""why the game is not suggested to buy"".

The game is a buggy mess, if you followed the recent news. And those are not bugs that you can overlook and won't annoy you during your gameplay: they really mess up your experience within this game. The performance is bad if you don't own an RTX or a graphics card, capable of Ray Tracing, just because of it's performance requirement. 
The missions are repetitive. You go there, either use your playstyle to finish the mission (stealth, rushing in against the enemy's front lines and etc.) and you don't even get a fair chunk amount of money, if not later in the game, and trust me money is important in this game to keep your character equipped with latest level equipment, important to finish hard missions later on. I think these secondary missions are the reason I have 48 hours on the game, or else I would've spent only about 8 hours and that's it.
Another aspect that really got me incredibly disappointed is the amount of choices in romance-stories: for every gender there are 2 romance tales you can experience. Either hetero- or homosexual one, and that disappoints me, since I would've preferred to have more romance choices (hetero and homo) available to experience, since the devs also promised that would be in the game, but was not delivered. Shame.
The thing is I am not finished yet. I could tell you the visual bug about the following vehicle ""Colby Little Mule"", if you decide to drive in first person, and the list can go on with me describing every little detail (Not to mention the ps4/Xbox One disaster).

Now you should've reached the point where you ask yourself: why do you have 48 hours inside the game then?
It's because I was overhyped and spent my 60€ immediately on the game, and before I could refund it, it was already too late. So I might aswell play it till the end and share my experiences with people that would like to buy this game and have the chance to read my review to get a quick summary of the game. And to be honest the game is not that ""bad"", it's just mismanaged and some content was cut off from the game, hence why it turned out to be review-bombed by many as negative. And whose fault it is? Not the devs fault, but most certainly the executive's fault, because they overhyped a project of ""8 years long"" and most of the things they promised, they didn't deliver. As a result they ruined their Company-image. This means nobody will ever trust this company anymore like before. Sad, if I can say.
So if you wanna still buy the game, with all the points I summarised above, don't complain that you spent too much on an unfinished, unpolished messy game. 

In my opinion this game does not deserve the price tag of 59,99€, but maybe 20-30€, because it seems like playing an open-beta version of the game. 

So therefore would I suggest the game?

""No"", not at this state. I cannot recommend this game at the moment. However if you wanna try the game at all cost, but don't wanna spend 60 bucks on it,  what I can recommend is to either get a steam key for a cheap price somewhere else or wait till christmas sale and hope the game will cost about 30-40€ (one can hope).

Therefore don't let the ""missing out"" marketing tactic manipulate you :)
You aren't missing out on anything, trust me.",False

At this point i wonder if rumors about 2 years of development time are true.

"Overall, a fun game with immersive bugs, deserving of a 8.5/10, which I'd round up to a 9.  Actually, since I'd round that 9 up to a 10, I'm gonna give the game a 10/10.  Hell yeah.  

Now let me tell you about [redacted by CPDR].

It's worth noting that I had to crank down the settings to get 60 fps on PC, but it was to be expected so I can't fault the game for that.  The game could definitely be more optimized.  DOOM spoiled us all.  Overall the game plays more like an adventure game, which is like saying it's not quite an open world RPG like Skyrim.  Maybe like a lite version of an open world RPG.  Which ain't bad, especially if you are a more casual player.  The game's not Obsidian-tier deep.  Again, not necessarily bad.  There's like straight up porn in some of the in-game ads (e.g. billboards) which I feel ambivalent about. I am not sure if my 8bitdopro+ controller works yet, so far it doesn't, but I'll update the review if my not-so-cybernetically enhanced skull sponge can figure it out.",True

"I've waited 7 years for this game i know this game since they revealed teaser and i was so excited. It's been long time but unfortunately for long years + many delays this game is unoptimized and bugged. You need 10K PC if you want to run on max settings with 60FPS. This game is unplayable for me, i am getting 15-30 fps and hardware requirements is not high so it looks like it's fake because i never get 30 or 60 FPS with my rig. (high settings) I hope they will optimize it... Since it's hard to enjoy on 20 fps even on low and med settings, i have to use GeForce Now and with that i'm getting 50-60 FPS. 
The world, universe, story, Johnny Silverhand is amazing but they showed/promised a lot of things that is missing on retail. Also you can't change the hair? NPC's are boring in this game and the police are wtf? Cops are teleporting behind you. This game should've delayed 1 or 2 years more. It needs a lot of work to fix and improve the game.
I know devs will do something to fix this game by then i will change to positive review.",False
"The problem with the game is not just the bugs and performance - the world itself feels shallow and dead. There are few interesting quests here and there but overall they are just simply ""go there - kill a guy - take loot"". The game looks more like a looter shooter rather than an rpg. The mechanics and AI cannot be compared to the games that were released a decade ago. 

I feel sorry for devs and truly believe that they wanted to make a fantastic game, but I don't think that fixing bugs and fps would make a big difference. Despite everything I wrote above, I still think many people could enjoy it, but it's definitely not a masterpiece.",False
"Cyberpunk 2077 is an amazing role-playing game, with sadly too many rough edges at the moment, something that happens when your project is overestimated and mega ambitious, and a quarantine that was mishandled. 

It's a game that I highly recommend playing, because despite the bugs and glitches it has (which are quite a few) and the horrible optimization, all the problems that so much stained the image of the game are only on the technical side, which is totally fixable in a month or, maximum, a year, and when all that is over, most of you will be able to see the immense potential of this game that it has in its narrative, but if the case of criticism had been in the story, well, that you can never patch it.

The story is godlike great, they managed to narrate a game with the same quality of The Witcher 3, there is no downgrade on that side, no exaggeration; All the dialogue that exists in this game is the most natural thing I've seen in years, V is a solid protagonist, and Johnny Silverhand doesn't just show up as a cameo or something, he's with you everywhere and everytime, EVEN on sidequests, which is 10/10. 

I honestly had lost hope in having a character with a voice after seeing how they did it in Fallout 4, but V [b]ACTUALLY[/b] has an ongoing conversation with anyone, and they say exactly what you were expecting, and it just works like butter, plus you can unlock dialogue options depending on your skill level (like having 100 science in Fallout or something like that) and so can your origin, which can save your skin several times.

The side-quests are pretty good, each one ends up being really interesting and you can see the good amount of work that has been done on them, like, holy sh*t, there's way too many cutscenes done for them and a lot of Silverhand's interaction.

The whole world of 2077, both the Badlands and Night City, is Cyberpunk goodness, the art direction in this game was handled very well, even in low settings everything looks very nice, the lighting is spot on, and there's so much eye-candy sights, some may remind you of Blade Runner's atmospheres, there's a few visual references too, like the burning pipes or the headlights at night.

I don't want to say much because I would seriously enter spoiler territory, but here comes the meh data: 

The combat and the driving in this game are very weak points, but I can't complain too much, after all CD Projekt Red had pretty big transitions, which were: Moving to first person, Having firearms, Program vehicle handling for the first time, Having modern/futuristic themes, and deep character creation, things that people at CDPR never worked on after working with The Witcher series for years.

What else? The characters, well written and well acted, most of the time, each one has something so special in them, they just instantly become unforgettable people in the storyline. I won't say much, but Johnny ended up being one of the most memorable ones of all. I highly recommend that you complete the sidequests related to his past, there's a lot to uncover, and most of it can end up pretty sad.

Going back to some miscellaneous themes, the photo mode is the BEST photo mode I've seen in my life, super varied and customizable, with some limits but I had a lot of fun using it, both ironically and seriously. The music in this game is what I expected, pure synthwave or darkwave goodness, and that song on the menu, UGH, I love it. The performances in this game are of the same quality as the narrative, and I liked the female V actress more than the male, male sounds... a very forced attempt at rough and tough guy, but it still does its job. The radios are... weird, but, in a strange way it's appealing in the futuristic context that the game is in, but that Jazz radio is perfect for driving on a rainy night in Night City.

So, yeah, I promise you for sure that the game is worth it 100%, only at this moment it's a rough diamond, it's not ready, it needs extreme polishing, but after all there's a diamond in hands, there's a gem, that little by little is going to be fixed, but nothing in this game can stop you from enjoying it at all, it's just janky and clunky at times but nothing to f*cking scream your guts out in the internet, jeez. 
[spoiler]Unless you played it on PS4 or XBone, then I'm so sorry for you[/spoiler]

It's funny. It's a very similar situation like Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, they rushed the release of an ambitious videogame and it came out disastrously, mostly in consoles, but CDPR are lucky to have their company alive and well and not, you know, [b]bankrupt[/b] and an immense amount of money to repair damages, both the game's and the company's, because holy sh*t their practises were a f*cking mess, but they have something that VTMB couldn't have at hands to come out in a complete state, even though that game is currently being fixed by the fans (but it took [and it's taking] lots of years). 

For now, just wait some time, but in the meantime, you can give it a try.

8.5/10

"The world in this game is extremely static, there is almost no interaction you can do, the NPC AI is sometimes worse than in Morrowind. Speaking of Elder Scrolls, that series has learned a long time ago its a bad idea to have skills level with jumping or running, but not this CP. For example to level Athletics you have to use stamina...so you end up punching the air every chance you get.

The char customization is lacking and the game is so unfinished, you can not change anything about your char after creation, not even the hair.
The whole game is unfinished, for exmple the 3 origin stories have been reduced to basically being a 5 minute interactive cutscene at the start of the game. They clearly were supposed to be more and have several tutorial missions.

The game also runs relatively poorly and just has a ton of bugs and gameplay issues.


Witcher 3 was a bit buggy at launch but this is a whole different level.




UPDATE: I played a bit more and this game is not an RPG, its an action adventure game with a lot of scripted scenes and sadly the scripted nature of the scenes is almost always very apparent, removing all your immersion.


Definately not my game, bit departure from the Witcher games, i am sad now.",False
"I wasn't completely convinced at the start, but boy, have I practically devoured this game in these days. I'm sorry this might seem like a big stream of consciousness, but bear with me if you want to know my opinion.

The truth is (at least my take on it) is that most of the game's graphical glitches I experienced were before I updated my NVIDIA drivers, after that? Not so much.
Granted, the game has the occasional visual glitch, in 60 hours maybe two quests broke that were easily fixed by reloading a previous game.

All in all? An excellent experience, the positive far far outweighs the negative.

Everyone who saw me play this game on Steam was riddled with questions and opinions, I'm honestly getting a bit sick of everyone talking about the game, especially if all you have to say to me is ""Quit having fun! The launch on console was a disaster! The game is horrible!"".

Yeah, not the best launch in the industry, but few remember how glitched Witcher 3 was at release.
Yes, I too long for a time where games came out completed, but I'm positive that if we give the devs enough time they will not only fix most of the bugs but also add content to an already spectacular game. (Did anyone count how many bugs to this day has Skyrim? No? Yeah...)

+ Roleplaying/Dialogue:
This is not the best dialogue system I've ever seen, but it's up there, for a sandbox experience like this I would say I'm pleasantly surprised. The intial part of the game feels a little bit on the rails but the more you stick with it the more it opens up to you.
The choices you make, especially in dialogues, while not all of them influence the story or are particularly relevant, allow you to express yourself, V has numerous answers and even actions during dialogue that allow you to immerse yourself in this world. It seems simple at first, yellow answers progress the dialogue, blue choices give you more insight, but you never feel compelled to just choose all the blue choices and then go on. Some blue choices are deceptive, stupid or offensive remarks for example that the characters might comment on, and while most of them don't change much, it kinda makes you think what do you really want to say. Better yet, there's sometimes multiple yellow choices to advance the dialogue, some that will influence the romance with a particular character, some that might avoid you a boss fight I previously thought was not avoidable, and so on. You can take a sip of your drink while talking, you can talk to different people in the same conversation and some choices are deceptive, some are gated behind your background (as a streetkid in a side mission, I could gain access to a guy posing as a drug peddler, that was great), some are gated behind stats like intelligence or coolness, and yeah, maybe that cool response dictated by your cool stat didn't change much in the grand scheme of things, but it's fun to choose nonetheless.
All in all, I'm astounded and I feel like this is a big step up from other games in the genre.

+ Combat:
While it seemed clunky to me at first, the gunplay is pretty satisfying, especially once you get some perks under your belt, the guns have weight to them and it's satisfying to land those headshots. There were some sections I felt that the enemies were literal sponges of bullets, but then I realized that I was in a much higher area than my level.
The melee combat feels ok, I'm not the biggest fan of it, feels a little bit simplistic but it's serviceable and I don't mind fighting in melee, but I can imagine this could be improved.

+ Graphics, Atmosphere, Music:
The graphics are gorgeous and not that demanding as other people would make you believe. My friends with a 970 can run it with medium settings and more than 40+ fps, which to be fair, as long as you don't dip under 30 is fine. I run a 1060 and with a few tweaks it's great.
The atmosphere is awesome, gritty, feels like playing deus ex again and the music is superb, I'm not a big fan of all the tracks, but there are definitely some great ones in here.

+ Stealth/Hacking
Yes, I'm one of those people that grew up with stealth games and loves stealth sections.
The stealth in this game is great, it's simple and effective. The only thing I can say is that... it's quite easy. Unless the enemy facing you is a sniper, the range they detect you is not very big and they have to max a bar to really go in alert mode. My current character uses Stealth a lot, I've put some points into the tree but I honestly didn't feel the need to pick the perk that says you're harder to detect... because honestly you're already quite hard to detect. If you're playing a hacker, this is even easier, you can blind enemies for a few seconds, and my current character can block an entire gang of people for up to 20 seconds, sneak up to them and stun all of them non lethally... or just hack them from afar and non-lethally make them burst into flames and electric sparks (Yes, non lethally, let's go).
It is enjoyable however and I like it, paired with hacking you can do some fun stuff, distract enemies, take control of turrets and cams, force the enemy to suicide, induce cyberpsichosis to a bunch of people so they shoot each other, you can get creative with it, I really like all the possibilities. Also hacking is pretty satisfying in open fights too, you can put down or debuff some people while you shoot at others, I sometimes forego in some side missions and criminal activity reports just to hack, shoot and revel in the combat. I was going for a non lethal playthrough but after a while you realize that the game expects some casualties on your part, so you let loose sometimes.

+ Levelling/Stats/Perks
While the system didn't click at first, after a while I understood what it's about, I don't love it but I like it a lot. It combines seamlessly the importance of choosing your stats, slowly specializing your character, but also, you train up your skills by levelling them up.
So you get better at using weapons or particular tactics (like quickhacking, stealth and such) but you also have to invest perk points to that particular tree under a specific statistic you also raise. The higher the stat governing that skill (the stats govern either 3 or 2 skills) the higher your cap ceiling and the more perk tree you have unlocked to invest points into.
This not only makes me feel like I'm actually improving my skill but using it, but also investing points to make it better and ignoring the ones I don't intend to use.
I have to say, it feels like the best of both worlds, I like this approach, my only compaint is that some of the perks feel uninspired, +5% damage, +10% reload speed, yeah yeah, same oldies... but then you go further into the tree and it does have it's charms and satisfactions.

+ Story
Your background determines your origin story, but don't expect to play a different story entirely. The origin story might be maybe one hour long to introduce you to the world from a different perspective, but you always end up in the same conundrum as all of them.
Your backstory is great however in the dialogue choices, even unlocking some new paths in sidequests or giving you knowledge about the affairs of what your character would naturally know. It doesn't pop up always, but when it does it's a nice touch. I don't want to spoil the story but it is pretty engaging, I felt immersed in these characters and their stories, so I'm satisfied and I won't elaborate further to let you be the judge.

And finally, I'm running out of space so here goes for the cons. My gripes with this game are not many, but they are there, some bugs, some mechanics not fleshed out, some content could be improved and added, I feel like this is a beta of a game, not a released product, but as said at the beginning, the positive far far outweighs the negative.

"After ten continuous hours of Cyberpunk 2077, I have to say that Night City is visually stunning, the story seems interesting enough, it's a fun game to play.

But it's not without its flaws; it crashed four times, there was an enemy that was glitching out pretty hard, and the first six hours basically has you on rails, which gets pretty frustrating after a while.

For a game with developers who insist its a role-playing game, the RP aspects are...limited. It's still kind of on-rails-y, and V definitely has a personality that isn't mine; lines of dialogue will often get emotional in ways I wouldn't. I'm making choices, yes, but I'm not really playing the character I want to play sometimes.

There have been a few missions where it was rather unclear what I was even supposed to do. There is also one part of a mission where certain parts of the map are off-limits, and if you go there, every NPC attacks you immediately...but it's not at all clear WHY; there were no warnings, no signs, no nothing, just cross a door's threshold and people start shooting you. Weird.

And the subtitles get annoying because it's hard to not read them WAY faster than the dialogue is spoken, but turning them off is a problem because sometimes people speak in languages that aren't English, and the subtitles translate for you...but if they're off...

But it's easy to criticize a game. And it's easy to sound like I actually don't like it if negative criticism is most of what I say.

It really is a beautiful game, and I think I've explored the tiniest, tiniest percent of Night City; the map is HUGE!
It's populated by a diverse set of NPCs who are walking around in extremely natural ways. Every street is unique; where a game like Grand Theft Auto seems to cut-and-paste a lot of their buildings, CP2077 feels like a real city; if it were VR, the immersion factor in this game would be goosebumping.

The characters are well-acted and the motion capture lends so much verisimilitude. There were a few completely unexpected deaths--and one I KNEW was coming cuz it was in one of the trailers, but damn, if I didn't tear up a little--and it leaves me wondering what could be coming next, if characters I thought were gonna be uber-prominent could die at any moment.

And Johnny Silverhand's running commentary is...interesting. I can't really explain it; you'd have to see it. But, I mean...at one point, I was just walking down the street, and suddenly he wants me to stop, listen to a dude busking on the sidewalk, then asks me for my opinion.
It was so random, and yet...so human.
It comes up a lot.

The sheer amount of side-content is crazypants; you could focus on the main game if you wanted to, and I'm told it's not super-duper-ooper long--some people have done a speedrun in 20 hours--but there are so many side missions you can take (and who knows whether they have an effect on the story, cuz they might) that the game could take hundreds of hours and you'd still see very little of it.

Anyway, I'm really just starting out; maybe I'll have more to say later. But I will say that it was worth the wait; here'z hoping they patch it soon, though, to fix some of those glitches.",True

"A massive let down.

Nevermind the bugs, but there are features missing that were suggested in the advertising. 
Cyberpunk 2077 is a game loosely based on a marketing campaign. 
It's bullshit that once the game releases they take out the RPG tag as this would amount to a crummy RPG.

The endings are all horse shit and you end up sitting with 2 ultimately shit endings no matter how much thought and time you put into the game.

There needs to be many many gbs of added content and fixes to make it worthwhile.
Assassins Creed Odyssey was better than this, if you were looking for a single player experience for the holidays, I'd sooner suggest Valhalla even though I haven't played it yet",False
"Follow 3 things to play the game:

1. Install latest graphics driver to avoid crashes.

2. After 1, If You think You are unable to make progress in the game due to a glitch, exit and restart the game, things will sail after that. The game auto-saves all stages of a mission.

3. Enjoy the Story and Gameplay. Let the guns do the talking!!

Detailed review to follow after I finish the game.",True
"This game is a scam, a money grab and nothing more. They rendered this game and uploaded ""game-play"" trailers and built the game based on these renders. The trailers are almost uncanny when compared to current game-play. This game is really a pseudo-non-linear action game. The ""rpg open-world"" aspect of this game is almost non existent because CD Project Red didn't have enough time to finish it (for whatever reason).

You role play as a character who on most occasions only has 2 different voice line choices. Your dialogue choices do very little to sway the world beyond some simple ""I kill you vs I spare you"" type of effect. More over, throughout the game, your reputation in the world and the way the world treats you is scripted, street cred means nothing. The loot system in this game is also meaningless. Looting better weapons and armour involves picking up multiple marginally worse or better guns until you find some type of legendary which will make looting useless for the next couple hours or so. Crafting does nothing as it scales with what kind of weapons or armour you are finding so you can never craft a better item. 

The open-world is seemingly full of life, but once you really start to pay attention, the world becomes very monotonous. Driving AI is not in this game and the cars follow set road paths and rarely compensate for obstacles such as other cars or the player. You can cause a 30 car traffic jam (or however many until the game decides to not spawn anymore cars) because you blocked the road with another car. NPCs also have no basic AI, they will respond to threats in 3 ways; no response, cower/crouch in the same frozen position, or run out of view to be de-spawned and replaced with another NPC. NPCs also follow set paths on sidewalks and crossroads as well. 

All that being said I would like to say the story is good, but is ruined by the fact that the animations are buggy and don't work properly 60% of the time. Watch as important characters lips stop moving when they talk, or have them snap into t-pose for a quick second,  or walk through objects, etc. Not worth any money, this game should have never been released like this, CD Project Red lied about this game and what it was, and is, supposed to be.

The bottom line is that this game was advertised to be a heavy role playing game where you could be what ever you wanted in an breathing, live open world. Whats even more crazy is why people are putting up with this. As of today, CD Project Red has made no statements about this horrible launch and the lies about what this game was supposed to be, but released a hot fix that fixed a handful of quest related bug fixes.",False
"Game is awesome! Story is amazing, city is easy to lost to.. also a lot of bugs, but team is working on regular patches to solve them. Gamepley feels mix of Deus Ex, Watchdogs, Far Cry, so if You have played any of those recently maybe cooloff. Also get good PC specs, because this game eats a lot and gives great results in return.",True
"This game is missing so many basic features, and things advertised by the devs that it truly makes me think the game was made only by a design team who made Night City. I'm not even rating this game based on the bugs, and there are plenty.

Night City is beautiful, but it is devoid with interaction. You can go to a bar, but the most you can do is buy from the bartenders inventory, you cant sit in any chairs, you cant ""have a drink"" it's literally just a vendor. And that is the same experience for any other interesting place in the game. 

For a game advertised about style, there isn't much customization. You cannot change your character at all after you leave the character creator, clothing has stats associated with them, so if you found that really cool jacket, you likely wont be wearing it long as it will be outclassed after the next quest. Clothing vendors also don't seem to sell ""Styled"" clothing properly ie being in an expensive part of town doesn't mean the vendor will sell expensive looking clothing. The vehicles also weren't spared, you cannot customize cars in any way, you just buy the car as is. Also, the handling and sounds for the cars are very sub-par. CDPR has a 5 minute video showing all the  lengths they went through to make the cars feel real and sound real. The cars are too floaty and want to power slide anytime you hit the brakes. Sound wise, they have one revving up sound effect that plays after every gear shift.

The AI are abysmal. In combat, they just hide behind something, peak and shoot and maybe lob the occasional grenade. They don't have any tactics, and outside of combat AI just drive around statically. They don't know how to drive around your parked car either. There seems to be one side quest that actually allows you to race in the game, but since there is no proper AI, they don't actually race, you just drive hitting checkpoints while the other ""racers"" teleport in clumps behind you trying frantically to keep up. 

There are a plethora of other basic gameplay features that just aren't there. You cannot rebind keys, there is no dedicated walk button, the skip dialogue button is the same as the toggle crouch, certain dialogue triggers can go off without waiting for the previous if you are moving freely in a mission causing dialogue to overlap and get out of sync or begin replaying. Those are the ones that stood out most to me.

Story writing isn't my forte but it seems to be well written. You will want to see how it ends but with the way everything else is adding up, it makes it hard to engage in. 

I've left a lot of things out because I'm not a reviewer, but this game is severely lacking some of the most basic things that seemed to be advertised by CDPR. My rating sits at a 2/5 and it's only that high because of how pretty Night City is, almost as if that's were all the development time went to. This game will require some extensive patches and content updates to feel complete. Note updates, NOT DLC, this game doesn't feel like a full fledged game.

"A great City to explore, a nice but unfortunately too short Story and it feels like a cheap looter-shooter.
Gameplay is okay for me.
The AI and open world experience is underwhelming for a open world game released in 2020. A small cleaning robot is much more capable of pathing around me not as the NPC´s in this game.

If you like a good Story then get it on a sale (35$ should be more than enough).

"First of all I have received this game as a gift from my friend.

I'm completely new to Cyberpunk 2077 universe but the story in my opinion is great the characters are amazing and I've got really invested into the whole story, man the ending I got even set me in a strong mood for the rest of the day which is amazing I think. The atmosphere is great, the music is brilliant.

However, this is a half done game, full of glitches and bugs which are breaking your immersion left and right every minute unless you can see them funny and just get over it. Optimisation is terrible probably the reason I could enjoy the game because I have a high end PC which made the experience better a little bit, but on mid - low end PCs you would suffer as my friends and housemates did and for them made the game not enjoyable.

Many times I was forced to load back a few hour older save because the game just bugged out so bad, I had to restart the game or reload the save many many times to fight glitches like not being able to sprint, T posing characters, and lost equipment when I tried to stash them to my vehicle's trunk.
The NPCs are either dumb or godlike, the traffic system is terrible and the difficulty settings are like 3 easy mode and the very hard is medium, a few hours in the game you already feel like invincible which is pretty boring in my opinion.

Over all I have enjoyed the game but had moments where I just quit because of a game breaking bug and keep in mind I never paid for the game.
As it is in 2020 I would not spend money on this game since its not a finished product.",False

"Have to say this game is pretty much everything i expected it to be. Thats all good things too. A few minor bugs (not being able to pick random items up from the ground being one and an issue with the nvidia game ready driver they put out the day of launch causing the game to crash every 20 mins being the biggest). 

The biggest issue i have with the game are quality of life things that just bug me. A few ill list below but honestly they are minor things that dont take away from the story, setting or fun of the gameplay. FYI though if you're playing on very hard cover and meds are your friend no matter how tough you get or how good the weapons you're using are.
-No way to customize your character in game more seems lame for a setting all about changing your body and look. Why is there no barber to change hair styles at least?
-The menu is a big clunky in places to get to things. Also the shards tab under journal is weirdly placed almost buried in the menus.
-Why is it when i hit M to bring up the map M doesnt take me out of the map? It just does some weird zoom feature that doesnt really seem needed or useful.
-Wish the music had some more synthwave sound to it. The kind of sound you think of when you think cyberpunk setting.",True
"Let me preface this by saying that I DO enjoy the game and think that it's quite fun, and that visually it is stunning. Unfortunately I cannot in good conscience recommend the game to anybody at the time of writing this. Cyberpunk 2077 has some truly stunning set pieces, with a decent and intriguing story set in an interesting world, but when it comes down to gameplay it falls flat. Riddled with crashes and numerous bugs ranging from minor inconvenience to out-right game breaking, it can be difficult to play without thinking that it wasn't ready to be released. While some of these issues will no doubt be addressed in future patches, some issues lie at the core of the game and are most likely unfixable at this point in time. 

While the world is huge and dense with NPCs, a closer look reveals it to be hollow and devoid of substance. Little to no interaction with the environment or the people supposedly inhabiting in leaves it feeling like a tech-demo more than a game, and the NPCs themselves hardly interact with the world as well which further breaks the immersion. AI pathing is near nonexistent, with cars and drivers have pre-set pathways that they will not deviate from, regardless of being shot in the head or having a car parked in front of them. AI will also disappear in an instant should you turn around, and police will simply spawn behind you, even when inside of a building with a single entrance. 

Cyberpunk 2077 also lacks customization despite being touted as an RPG, notably one with an emphasis on modification and fashion. No barber shops, plastic surgeons, or even the ability to change your characters makeup, be prepared to play the entire game with the same hairstyle and look as once you hit finalize on the character creation screen, that's it. Clothing is also limited with no way to transfer stats from one item to another, and with no cosmetic slots you will often need to make a choice between looking the way you want versus having decent equipment.

The game also has some problematic elements when it comes to representation and identity, tying your character's gender to whether you picked a masculine or feminine voice, completely ignoring the variation in human vocals in the real world. A small amount of romance options exist but are tied to specific combinations of body parts and voices means that for some players, only one or two will be possible at any given time. 

While not PC specific, CD Projekt Red also displayed shady business practices before the launch of the game, refusing to showcase or give out any review copies for the console versions of the game, as well as make reviewers use B-roll footage supplied to them by CDPR themselves. This attempt at hiding the true state of the game until it launched is deceptive and deceitful and should make you raise an eyebrow about why they continued with their plans to launch an obviously unfinished game.

Ultimately, I will continue to play it, and the game DOES have it's merits, but I don't feel comfortable telling anyone to buy it until it has had major, major work and polish done to it.",False

"- Is the game fun?  Yes... 40% of the time

- Is the game what was promised to us for years?  NO.  Not by a long shot.

 -This game is NOT an RPG, despite the fact that they marketed it as such.  Here's a few reasons why:
[list]
    [*]Your choices barely matter.  The life paths are completely meaningless outside of the intro and some likewise meaningless dialogue options that become available to you depending on your chosen life path.
    [*]Character Creation is STATIC, meaning there is no way to change your character's appearance once you've created it.  Not only that, but you are relegated to a single body type in character creation.  Want to create a muscular melee character?  Sorry, but they will look like a string bean.  That's your only choice.
    [*]The skill tree is bland at its best, broken at its worst.  There are perks that straight up DO NOT WORK in this game.  The ones that do work are meaningless stat percentage jumps, for the most part. 
    [*]The world does not interact with you, and you cannot interact with it.  Notice that I said CANNOT.  The world in Saint's Row 1 is more interactive than Night City
    [*]Crafting is fundamentally broken.  It's unclear which perks and mods stack and which ones don't.  If the Character Stat Screen was useful in any way, maybe you could understand what mods do to your character, but why would you want to accurately track character stats and understand what each of those stats do in an RPG, amirite????
    [*]Outside of a few side quests, the majority of quests are generic slogs that amount to going somewhere and shooting/stealing/hacking something.  
[/list]

- The driving is ""Watch Dogs 1"" bad.  Even with a mod that fixes the crappy mini-map, the driving still sucks

- I'm running with an i7 paired with a 1060 6gb, and, in the first week I owned this game, I spent more time in Nvidia Control Panel and modding .ini files than I actually did PLAYING the game just to get to a steady 30fps.  

[TLDR]
Look, the game has highlights, sure.  The game performance may be garbage, but the visual design is nothing short of inspired.  The gameplay loop outside of the main quest gets stale quickly.  The only reason I've racked up so much playtime is that I've tried three different character builds through the entire game.  All of them left me feeling unsatisfied.  I have seen people say that there is a great game buried under all the technical issues, but I disagree completely.  The city feels dead, the gameplay is repetitive and doesn't do anything new (and the things it does do, it doesn't do well), and the game that CDPR promised us is literally NOWHERE to be found.  I'm not mad, and this is not a rage review.  This game needs a No-Man's-Sky level overhaul, and NOTHING short of that will make this game anything more than a sub-par GTA reskin.

"[This review is written on 28th of December 2020, game vervion 1.06 and will be rewritten after the game will get fully fixed and get all the DLCs]
So, Let's start from the beginning. I didn't expect from this game no miracle or any 100 out of 10 musthave. I expected a normal game with a good story, which I got. Let's not bring up what we were promised and work with what we have right now. 

The main story is linear and your choices don't matter in much. There are only few times when choices will have effect in the ending and the main choice that you will need to make in the end.

Side quests are also linear but only with the romancable characters you will have a choice to start your romance or not. Also characters from side quests will appear in the end credits and if you completed the side quests completely, you will get one scene, if you complete it half it will be another and if you ignore (I don't know as I completed them all except Judy).

Map activities are pure grind of kill those,bring that,kidnap this,save that and so. Nothing unusual or creative.

Map itself is a medium size with many regions under different gangs but it has not much effect in the world. Every gang member is an enemy and only few times and under certain circumstances they may be allies.

Cops. In the current version of the game. NEVER.ANGER.THE.COPS. They will spawn behind you in hords and will try to kill you with anything they can get. No pursuits, just appearing from thin air and boom.

Let's get to gameplay. For a first FPS genre game. CDPR did good. Not perfect of course but good. Guns feel good. You can feel the recoil and there is a big variety of guns.Want a shotgun? Here is a shotgun. Want a shotgun that can shoot electro magnetic ullets that can pierce walls? Here you go. Want a big arse badarse shotgun? Here you go. Very big variety 

Cars. Big amount of cars that you will not use. Through all my game time, I used only 3 cars and nothing else. Maybe I got used to them or maybe an update broke it but cars felt heavier on release and I was surprised in a good way that it could be felt and now they almost fly off thhe road from high speed. At least bikes are made better than in mafia remake (Those were shoity as hell)

Bugs and animations. I experienced not that much bugs. I couldn't pick up items from the ground or bodie. I died few times from ladders,little hills,holograms. Funny thing. I didn't die from enemies even once for all these hours but did die from explosive barrels more than I can count. Animations of V walking or running are messed up and it looks like the jiggle. 

Graphics. The game needs optimization and a very HARD optimization. My new RTX 3070 woorked fine on Ultra settings but sometimes my FPS dropped to 40 at the city center and places with big amount of light but overall the graphics are nice. At night the city really starts to look all flashy and neon. Pretty nice.

Music is perfect in this game. Change my mind

So, this game is not perfect and many things needs tobe fixed but it is still a good game with a nice story. I noticed how many people say this ""Oh this game is buggy and broke but I still like it and enjoy it.""

So, let's wait when it will be fixed and get it's DLCs and then give it a rating that it deserves

This is all for now.",True

"Every product that has been hyped to certain ridiculous amount inevitably faces great number of people that are let down or disappointed. Truly, a large percent of negative feedback comes from ruined expectations. More so, people are upset with the technical part of the game, constituting of performance issues, bugs and other issues. While the latter can and most likely will be fixed eventually, the first part is a more sensitive problem.

As for me, I purposely did not watch any promotional media and pursue prior knowledge about the game before it came out. I have plenty of personal experience when hype does more harm than good. Rarely, if ever, your sky-high expectations are met. I trusted the good reputation of developer, since I greatly enjoy their older products and was interested in first cinematic trailer. I did not know exactly what I was getting into apart that it had a Cyberpunk setting, RPG elements and supposedly great graphics. Therefore, I was free from the shackles of expectations and enjoyed the product as is.

To start off, I can say that this is among the best AAA title RPGs in since Witcher 3. Triple-A distinction is important, since even mediocre roleplaying game made by indie studio has far more roleplay elements than Cyberpunk. Explanation could be that such 'simplification' is made with an effort to seem more accessible for an average player. A more passionate RPG, such as Disco Elysium easily outshines Cyberpunk in this regard. This does not mean, however, that the game lacks these elements whatsoever. It's just that even the most dumbed-out franchises, such as Call of Duty are starting to implement primitive dialogue systems and semi-non-linear gameplay. That being said, the game still offer certain degree of freedom of gameplay and certain choices in quests.

Moving on, I greatly enjoy the Narrative and overall writing. The main plot is gripping, characters for the most part enjoyable and interactions with them are interesting. While the main quest and side quests are excellent, the 'grindy' parts often lack depth to them and constitute of rather simple enemy raiding - come to a location, hear a briefing and then do an objective either stealthily or with a weapon of your choice. Still, game's mechanics and large amount of tools at your disposal do everything to delay the feeling of repetitiveness, which may happen eventually if you are a completionist.

Simply put, when it comes to action, be it subtle of guns blazing, its very enjoyable. I was at first upset that the game will suffer as a shooter due to headshots not being lethal and enemies having health bars. Thankfully, you can remove the health bars and damage indicators from hud, making it at least *feel* less borderlands style. Though, while you are in stealth with a silenced pistol, it almost always takes only one headshot to finish the enemy - unless its a boss fight. Movement is very responsive and running, double-jumping (with an augmentation) and parkouring around the Night City was just so enjoyable. More than driving vehicles for sure, which have odd driving physics. Motorcycles are somewhat better at that in this game.

As for visuals the game is stunning and truly a next-gen game. No wonder consoles are screeching and full of smoke when they even try to launch it. PC version looks and plays supreme, while still often suffering from visual bugs. Soundtrack I too enjoyed greatly, especially the Main theme and Silverhand theme. Overall its great and fitting to whatever happens on the screen.

Fantastic game, really. It most definitely could use two-three extra months of polishing, but apart from technicalities, I enjoyed it immensely and the time I spent on it flew by incredibly fast. Definitely will replay it in near future. Is it the next  Witcher 3? Not really, as that game was way bigger in scale. Does it give off the same emotions while playing? Oh yeah.",True
"Don't let the FUD and negativity coming from the console side confuse you, Cyberpunk is in a good state on PC. At over 90 hours, I haven't run into a single hard crash, and few substantial bugs. Performance is good, and the game plays great. There are plenty of issues that CDPR needs to address, but the PC experience is in no way comparable to the dumpster fire that's happening on PS4/ Xbox. The game is good, fun, and way better at launch than some other open world titles (lol Bethesda). 

It's far from the level of perfection that the hype train expected, but that was insanely unrealistic to start with. Open world games always have issues at launch, but in my experience on PC, it's nowhere near as bad as youtube or reddit make it out to be. That said, I wouldn't touch this game with a ten foot pole on current consoles, or a bloody sarissa on last gen consoles. The disparity in performance and player experience between PC and consoles for Cyberpunk 2077 is the largest I've ever seen at launch.",True
100%-10,True
"Cyberpunk 2077 easily made it into my personal all-time Top 3 Games, but before we get to the subjective parts, let me get the objective review out of the way:

There are plenty flaws in this game, albeit understandable, given the ambitions and size of it all, nevertheless, plenty bugs do still exist, only a handful of them may require you to save and load, to fix your situation.
The radio stations offer little Music that actually suits the Cyberpunk setting, i wish they had put Synthwave and Retrowave in here, but that's a personal gripe of mine.
Gameplay works just fine, but it feels very clunky and sub optimal, it is fun, sure, but it can often look and feel quite weird.
Some Sidequests don't make it obvious how you're supposed to proceed, may also be leading back to certain bugs anyway.
And last but not least, the game is in dire need of optimization, the official recommended specs for high and ultra settings and resolutions are very fake, unless they were aiming for 30 fps.

Apart from those cons, Cyberpunk 2077 offers the so far (in my opinion) best Open-World experience i have come across, by far.
All the vehicles you can ride, at night, the photo mode, the amazingly well done visuals, animations, and all of the game packed into just 63 GB.
Compare the scope and visual quality of this game to Cold War, which requires 250 GB of space on PC.

Graphics:                      Great

So much shit to do in this game.

It's Grand Theft Auto in the future where corporations have finally given up playing the state's game, and are now the state. Or rather, the state doesn't exist and it's a broken shitty state framework propped up by private corporate tech. Closest thing I can think of is some kind of techno feudalistic world

The combat is pretty good. I started off with pistols and rifles but ended up just using Katana. It's highly effective. Perhaps too effective?

Plenty of shit to do. Emotive, realistic characters. Tearjerking scenes. Grenades (great for bugfix keep reading).

--- BUGS --- 

Bugs? More like hilarious features. Only once did a bug literally impede me from playing. I save regularly. So it wasn't a problem.

Sometimes enemies will disappear into the ground. Solution? Throw a grenade at the ground where they are. They are no problem then.

Sometimes when you smash a window you will be thrown backwards 300-400 feet. Solution? Gotta run back to the window. Get fit. OK, this one pissed me off.

Sometimes when you 'summon' your vehicle, It''ll run you over. It's just hilarious, nothing more. Or it'll go *beep beep* and then smash all other vehicles out of the way as it relentlessly approaches you. Once again, hilarious.

Sometimes lead conversations will go wrong, like a quest gets stuck. All you can do is 'throw the die' and reload. Maybe it'll work?

There are probably hundreds more bugs, but I didn't nitpick too intensely at every single detail. Maybe if you don't relate to that, you will have a bad time. These bugs above I think everybody would recognised if they played.",True

"Final verdict :
Last thoughts as this game is unfinished and the marketing scheme was a big scum to get the preorders in and sell copies, the absolutely no true apology and not even a dev leak of this shit show, i stand by please do not ever buy CDPR projects products ever and forever ever after!

Here is my experience step by step.

I am still playing it to see if anything changes, but the performance is crap, bugs and glitches in the game.

Not a full review yet but so far game is meh only pushing through. Updates to come.

1st edit - Play alone and really focus on the world stories, side quests and all the notes and details finally has made an impact, changing my review to positive.
2nd edit - Ehm more bugs, glitches, main story is not just short is suuuper short and no spoilers but its kinda underwhelming.
3rd edit - Was that it? Did the game deserve the hype? Well not at all

Its a buggy 6/10 game that you need a high end PC to play it. If you are on anything less than high end specs then the game is more like a 4/10 since the main point is the graphics etc.
Oh yeah final words the game is not next gen as marketed its same same as we have seen but with graphics pushed to the limits of current high end specs.

If you are not a huge fun of the genre wait for sales dont buy full price.

"Damn, can't believe I've sunk this many hours in the game already, and I'm nowhere close to even half-way. 

First off, yeah, it's got bugs, but I rate them as ""minor"". Usually little visual stuff that doesn't stick around long, hopefully easily patchable.

Secondly, it may surprise you with how hard it is to run. I get 40-60FPS with everything maxed out at 1080p on a 2080Ti and a 9th Gen i7. Which to be honest feels fine to me due to how gorgeous it looks, and that it's an open world game.

I'm thoroughly enjoying myself. The story absorbs me, I enjoy listening to the characters. The gameplay is fun and rewarding, if not rough around the edges due to bugs. With the only major gripe I have being the AI regarding Stealth. It's a bit wonky. 

If you want a less glitchy experience, wait for more patches is all I can say, but it will definitely be worth it in the end, this game's an absolute treat.",True
"Кто-бы что не говорил, а игра вышла добротной",True
Game is half arsed and should't have been released. NPC AI is about what you'd expect from a PS3 game. Bugs completely ruin the immersion in what is actually a pretty good story line although be it very linear with no a heap of choice in how your life paths actually play out. Gun play is fun but gets boring after a few hours. I'm at loss for how more people aren't demanding refunds after this games release with all of it's blatantly false advertising.,False
"Just finished the main story, here is what I have to say
The concept of Cyberpunk 2077 isn't bad, rather the execution of it is.
The game had so much potential but it looks like CD Projekt Red didnt feel like making it happen.
Good 30 dollar game, wouldn't buy it for more than that.

EDIT: Sidequests are even a bigger disappointment. The only meaningful ones really are the Judy, Panam, and Johnny ones. The rest just feel like clearing dots off the map. Still would avoid this game.",False
"Playing on a 8GB GTX 1070 and i5 9400f, and it runs well. Its a nice game.",True
"Can't fault the performance on my beefy rig from last year, that is without RTX stuff...

Still, there being soft-locking bugs in the first mission is unacceptable. I will recommend waiting for some months for this game to be in playable state.",False
"This game had so much potential, but it tries to do too many things at once and none of the things it does are 'groundbreaking' or honestly that good. There's average gunplay, average stealth mechanics, terrible driving among other things. The story is 'okay' at 13 hours in.

Night City looks amazing, all of the building designs and advertising looks really good, but the city is lifeless. Barely any NPC interactions, you can't buy food from 90% of food vendors, none of the many arcade machines work. The depth of the amazing city is definitely let down by not being able to interact with much outside of quests.

Performance is also not that great even with a 5800x and an RTX 3080.

I haven't experienced many crashes but there's lots of minor bugs that start to add up (T poses, floating items, enemies shooting through walls etc).

If Steam had a middle thumb I'd give it that but I just can't recommend it how it is at the moment. I'd give it a 6/10.",False
"Waiting for update. 
This is not about gameplay just technical issues. The minimum specs are an outright lie. i set every setting to low and scaled resolution down and still cant pass 17fps. i can play every other new game but this, so it has to be the optimization. I will change my review if this turd gets polished so i can actually play.",False
Rushed but good!,True
"I'm having a great time playing the game. There are the occasional bugs, but stuff that can't be fixed in a couple of weeks time. The gameplay is extremely fun, and there so many things to do. It's really easy to immerse yourself in a game. The negative reviews are just people complaining the entire world is not simulated by atoms.",True
"the game is amazing, sure there are obvious glaring issues and some much needed QoL improvements that must be made. but i must remind the dear reader that CDPR as a developer has been known to release games in states much like this. the witcher 3 and the witcher 2 were also insanely buggy messes that given enough time were polished and patched to such a degree some would claim they are GOTY material today. even going as far as adding new content and adding features missing from their games upon launch.

Now i personally reccomend you only purchase cyberpunk 2077 on the sole condition that you can play and enjoy a game fraught with bugs and other assorted issues if you wish to experience the world of Night City right now. or if you are content with waiting the 6 months to a year for the developers to take their time adding much needed polish and patches that will leave the game in a state that will repeat the quality of game that the witcher 3 commands, then i suggest you purchase the game in 6 months to a year's time.

in grand total, i recomend cyberpunk 2077, only if you can handle the issues current with this version of the game.

in time i will update this review and most likely reccomend the game completely when all the bugs and missing features are restored to their intended function",True
On my way Panam,True
"It is not a bad game per se. It will provide some entertainment in at least some form to pretty much anybody. That is one of its stronger sides. Did it live up to all the unbelievable hype and expectation? Certainly didn't. Even not meeting the enormous expectations, it could at least have been it's own unique thing - but it's not even that. GTA meets Deus Ex - literally. And GTA and DE are much better in their respective sub-genres than this, their mix. What mostly made me negative in the end is the quality of the writing - plot, dialogues and characters. At their best they are going to be just mediocre assortment of cliches put together in a more or less neat manner. It's not bad in itself - it has been done before and it can work. It's just the halfhearted way CP2077 does it that rather falls flat. At their worst they are facepalm-worthy plot holes and lack of logic. Sure, there have been worse, by far. But it's one of the things the game strives to shine at and fails in that. So, the world is a bunch of poorly thought-through cliches loosely put together, it's never a coherent whole. The plot is not horrible, but neither is it really good, too. The characters... this is maybe the worst thing about the non-gameplay part. The characters are absolutely empty. Some are slightly better, like Jackie, Judy and Takemura, but they are just a little bit more fleshed out than the rest of them - doesn't make them really good or interesting. The whole thing is supposed to hinge on Johnny Silverhand, played by Keanu Reeves. Jesus, even Keanu couldn't salvage this trainwreck of a writing for his character. Johnny almost never makes any sense. His character is, again, a bunch of cliches loosely put together. They never actually work together. His ""ideas"" are incomprehensible and they aren't even voiced clearly. His motivation is incomprehensible. Arasaka's decision to keep his engram is incomprehensible. You can go on and on and on with this. It looks like they didn't even care if it all makes any real sense or not. Gameplay... as a sandbox it works. As an fps it is absolutely horrible. AI is excruciatingly dumb, playing on the hardest difficulty is never hard at all. Just to illustrate some things that regularly happen in this game: you're driving a car through the city like a maniac, hitting every other car on way, knocking some occasional pedestrians down. Then you see some thugs (always highlighted) by the side of the road. You get out of the car. Take out your weapon - all of it in plain sight of dozens of people walking by. Maybe even in sight of a cop patrol car parked some 50m away. So, you take out your gun and just click their heads - one click each. They're dead. Civilians are running away. Cops do nothing. You casually walk up to the bodies, loot them, leave. If you were unlucky enough to accidentally(?) graze a non-highlighted citizen - new cops spawn behind your back in 1 second and immediately start shooting at you. You can't give up. You can, however, run away in literally any direction and after some 100m you're safe, they won't chase you and they'll forget about you in a minute. What ""realism"" or immersion can one talk about here?..",False
"Done with the most OVER HYPE game upto date. I'll put all cards on the table for this and will be honest about everything.
First the game itself in general in terms of story is pretty damn good. Has a lot of emotions in it. Even in credits scene it had it moments. 

Sidequests: If I'm to compare with the game this company made, yeah you guessed it. I'm talking about WITCHER 3. Compare to w3 sidequest its no where near it. Doesn't mean it is bad but the quality isn't that much high. I'll rate it decent.  

Main plot: Its all about JOHNNY SILVER FUCKING HAND. Trust me when I say this that guy single handedly kept the main story alive. The game isn't about V its about silverhand. And the way they twisted the relation between V and Silverhand was amazing. The ending is 10/10.

Sound: Don't got much to say about the sound but hey I loved the Jamaican tracks xD

Now lets talk about the BUGS. Since release this game has proven to be the best buggy game till date even failed Assassins Creed Unity. Trust me when I say this they can't fix the game no matter what. Won't talk about console port that's out of question but pc in general its gonna stay that way. Had to use LOAD game alot more than I saved xD. 

So overall I enjoyed it despite the bugs and all. I will rate this game straight 9/10.

"You start Cyberpunk 2077 and you're met with the dangerously beautiful Night City, a sprawling city of light, once meant to be a utopia on Earth but soon turned into a difficult place to survive in, where the majority of people struggle to get by in favor of a privileged minority (nope, you didn't end up on a news website on current events, we're still on Steam, don't worry). Cyberpunk world-building is indeed amazing thanks to a great scenery, brilliant architectural design and smart (if at times a bit edgy) ads and images to make the game world feel cohesive and relevant. The more you progress into the game, though, the more you come to realize that Night City is more like a shiny window-shop that you can admire from a safe distance but you cannot ever hope to touch and be part of. At the time of writing, you'll find no kind of optional activity or event to make you feel part of this insane world you find yourself into, no gambling, no mini-games, no interactions with NPCs if they're unrelated to the quest you're currently doing, no barber shops, no tattoo shops, you can't sit and have a drink and watch the crowd pass by, nothing of that kind of stuff we've come to expect in big open world games over the past two decades.

Sadly the same happens with the quests, they look good at first but soon you realize they're actually not that groundbreaking and probably worse than what we've seen in other games. Many of the quests can be approached in several different ways just like titles such as Deus Ex, Thief, Dishonored or Prey but they lack the polishing and coherence of all the aforementioned titles. Say you made a tech-based build, you'll find no keypad or similar stuff to hack and open doors with your tech abilities, you'll just find an uninspiring ""X tech points required to open this door"". Period. This is even more puzzling considering you can hack things left and right during your playthrough to collect loot but none (or very few) of those hackable things are in any way necessary to the quest.

To further add to the overall uninspiring structure of quests, as I mentioned above, you can approach most missions in your own way, that's right, most but not all. There are several instances when you'll find yourself forced to make your way through a particular area guns blazing, which is made tedious by bullet sponge enemies and bosses. The ""bosses"" in the game need a special mention as well: all those I met in the 30 hours I played so far rely on incredibly basic attack patterns that repeat forever until the annoying bullet-sponge battle is over.

All the aforementioned stuff comes BEFORE the well-known visual glitches (floating cigarettes and phones pretty much everywhere in Night City, NPCs standing and sitting continuously when you're talking with them, V doing a naked T-pose while on the motorbike and just an endless amount of glitchy animations) and annoying bugs (enemies spawning facing you when they were supposed to have their back on you when loading a quick-save or maybe losing their movement pattern, just to name a couple). All these will probably be patched at some point, but this is not an early access game so the issues need to be considered as such.

Despite all the issues, Cyberpunk 2077 is certainly an experience worth having for anyone who likes this kind of setting or similar games, maybe not right now but surely when all the bugs will be ironed out. I'd choose a neutral vote if I could but Steam's review system is ""all of nothing"" so I have to choose between those two and I can't, in good conscience, recommend Cyberpunk 2077 with all its current technical problems and with its underwhelming content which failed to meet mine, and I'm sure many other players', expectations.",False
"I have halted playing this game for now.
I believe there is a good game in there somewhere, so have decided to wait for it to be fixed first.
I cannot recommend this game to anyone atm maybe give it 6 -12 months extra time in the oven.",False
I bought into the hype and pre-ordered and now I feel stupid. I didn't experience any crashes but there were enough bugs to keep breaking the immersion. I can see what they were going for and some aspects of the game are fun and there are some good moments of storytelling and writing. But the main problem is that the game is unfinished and I guess I should have known better than to buy something before I know what I am getting. I thought CDPR was different to the other big games companies but looks like I was wrong.,False
"Imagine you go to the store to buy groceries, and the store is the world of Cyberpunk. Well, the world is only as open / deep as the grocery list that CDPR gives you. Outside of that list there is almost no agency, and nobody you meet and nothing you interact with outside of that list has any substance. 

So do I consider this game a success in regards to it's 'open-world' system? No.

Gameplay? The combat loops, be it guns, stealth, or hacking (or a mix of any / all), are all extremely simple and repetitive. I will say the enemies are fairly spongy, but I don't think this point is as horrible or exaggerated as other reviews make it out to be. Overall the mechanics aren't bad, but they are certainly nothing new. I feel as if they are bare minimum- and while bare-minimum works, it clashes with the grandeur of the game's environment. 

""Character progression"" in regard to leveling up and gaining skills is actually something I enjoyed in this game. You gain fair amounts of exp for the actions you take and it seems like all build paths are viable. I just wish that there were different mission outcomes based on the taken routes (stealth, hacking, guns blazing)

The game has plenty of bugs. Animation glitches, floating / stuck models, quests not being complete-able, weapons un-equip themselves, texture clipping, straight-up crashing, etc etc. Fortunately the game-breaking bugs are much less common than the non-game-breaking bugs- but the fact that I can't go 10 minutes without being taken of immersion due to a bug is something worth noting. 

But overall, the game still isn't bad, which is why I still recommend the game- but I also feel like the game doesn't live up to it's ambition. Ultimately, if you like on-rails-story  experiences you probably will be totally happy with the purchase, but if you were expecting to make your own character and experience your own story you will be left disappointed.",True
"Incredible graphics, the world feels alive and there's always something to do.
I'm only a few hours in but so far the story is great and the mechanics work together flawlessly.

Another awesome game by CDPR, just like i expected.",True
"Great game. Yes there are bugs and it needs some patching. But for the sheer amount of content I'm willing to forgive those things. The worst of the bugs seemed to be relegated to consoles for now, so don't let the stories you hear scare you away: game rarely crashes for me on PC. If you don't pick it up now, pick it up early next year when the big patches drop.  At the time I'm reviewing this, its probably as buggy as Skyrim was at launch.",True

"[b]My Review of Cyberpunk 2077[/b]

So, I'll start off by saying that I am a huge fan of The Witcher universe and especially The Witcher 3. I've read the books, and thoroughly played the game. I was a big fan of the company behind it, as we all know CDPR. Naturally, I was looking forward to CP2077, Almost 8 years in development, constant updates and a promising future! I was skeptical for the first delay but decided to allow it. I told myself that as long as the game was polished and perfect I'd wait more.

[b]The first sign of problems[/b]
The game was delayed again and although they did upload an ""email"" of sorts explaining the reasoning...I knew something was up. They fucked up...big time. They didn't manage the time well and there was something going on that we didn't know about (spoilers!: performance issues and unpolished features). Then it was delayed A THIRD TIME  so I was 100% sure they were running out of time. 

[b]Main Problems[/b]
Cyberpunk 2077 was supposed to be a game in a bustling metropolis of the future...a true next gen experience with many, many features, amazing graphics, story, great side-quests and features like inviting your friends over or having interesting interactions with NPCs. At least that's what we were promised. The game Arrived full of problems. I am not just talking about the INSANE amount of bugs, performance issues (especially on consoles) but the lack of an actual AI system, and immense lack of other features like in-depth character customization, replayability, ability customization, different outcomes depending on background and of course in-game relationships with other NPCs such as friends.

[b]AI[/b]
The AI is by far the worst AI I have ever seen in a AAA game. The NPCs spawn right in front of you out of thin air and disappear the same way. That is not by any means the intelligent next gen AI we were promised. Where are the routines and daily lives of the citizens of this city? RDR2 did it and is considered an old gen title not a ""next gen"" like CP2077 was supposed to be. The AI is so stupid I can't even put it into words. I feel like I'm playing a cheap imitation of a game. The police just spawn wherever you are, EVEN on rooftops. It's so disappointing. I am very confident even an inter programmer could make a better AI system than this sorry excuse. All in all I would give the AI system a 3/10 merely because there is one to begin with.

[b]Character customization[/b]
The character customization is once again a feature we were promised, with great detail especially. We would be able to fully customize our characters to fit our ideal model. What we were given was a generic customization menu. We were just given some options we could select. Hairstyle, eye color, hair color, beards. That's about it. It is not in-depth at all! To add to that, you rarely even look at your character in-game. Even if you did, there are no barbers in night city in case you want to change the way you look, a feature that The Witcher 3, a game created 5 years ago has! On top of all this, the clothing in this game is meaningless, everyone just selects the clothes with the highest stats making them practically useless. Next time you open this game, take a look at your character. You probably look like a clown that ran away from the circus because the higher level you become, the better the drops are and frankly I'm very disappointed once again.

[b]Replayability?[/b]
At the moment I have 58 hours in the game and feel no need whatsoever to replay it. I went with a typical ""netrunner"" build because I found it interesting. I feel like I've experienced almost everything this game has to offer in terms of combat. At the starting levels I was forced into using guns like assault rifles and even played with the melee weapons to see how they felt until my netrunning abilities improved because it is a late-game build. During that time, I experienced the combat the way other builds would. The gun play is so boring. You just spray into the enemies until they die, the other builds just have better damage in terms of numbers. The only fun gun I actually used was the revolver while doing stealth. The melee weapons are the same, you just spam mouse 1 until the enemy dies. There is no real skill or interesting aspect. And before you ask about mantis blades and such, they are the same as other melee weapons. You just smash your buttons until the enemy dies. I wouldn't call this replayability because it just simply doesn't have anything unique to provide.

[b]Abilities, builds[/b]
As noted previously, the abilities were also disappointing. At least in the netrunning section, apart from some hacking abilities that did different types of damage there was pretty much nothing else. All the upgrades are just number changes. The ""feature"" of enemy weakness isn't even needed. Personally, I just spammed my hacks until all the baddies were dead showing indifference towards their weaknesses (played on hard difficulty). I wish I am wrong about this but I feel like even the other builds have a similar problem. You get more attack speed, more damage, more critical chance and damage and that's about as far as abilities go.

[b]Background[/b]
The background of choice does in no way affect the gameplay. All you get is meaningless dialogue options that do not change any part of the story. There are no unique skills, abilities or characteristics unique to backgrounds. It's just another meaningless option you select at the beginning of your game. Does not even affect romance options.

[b]Leisure activities[/b]
This game is supposed to be situated inside a city of course, and a notorious at that, night city. Night city is dead on the inside. There is nothing interesting to do. In GTA V, you can go for tennis, go to the casino, go play golf, watch a movie and many, many other activities. Cyberpunk 2077 has ZERO activities outside of side quests. And even the side-quests were few compared to The Witcher's 3 side-quests that were even in my opinion more interesting at times than Cyberpunk's.

[b]The good things of this game[/b]

There are some things in this game that I did actually find enjoyable though. Firstly, the music is amazing. I loved the songs ""SAMURAI"" did which were actually from a band called Refused. The music really fits the setting and I think it's one of the few things they got right.
The story was also alright, I did not find it amazing but I liked it. The events were well knitted into one another and the endings were not what everyone expected. Spoilers ahead.
[spoiler]The sad endings of our story is something I will remember, they were really, really well done and took me by surprise. The story of Jackie's death and us trying no matter what to survive was interesting to say the least. Becoming data inside Mikoshi or living our last months either with Panam and the Aldecaldos or staying in night city are not the endings I had anticipated.I think I will remember them for a long time.[/spoiler]
But that is as far as the story will take it. The city feels dead.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
While I had some expectations I was careful not to fall into the hype train. I anticipated for the game to be a good experience with the necessary features that were promised to make this experience good. We were given a sorry excuse of a game. After 7 months of delay CDPR presented an unfinished game with lots of issues. Do not fool yourself and blame the programmers and developers. They have been in cruch for over a year. The Witcher 3 had the same issue and honestly it's a shame that in 2020 workers are forced into such inhumane situtations. To those defending the developers because gamers ""couldn't wait"", you are a fool at best! We were lied to again and again only to be disappointed in the end. If you can enjoy this game...good for you! But for me, and many others this is something I cannot forgive so easily. Wait for improvement before buying!",False
"Wait and play it in a year or so. The game looks good, nice design and the story itself and the side quests are cool. 
Besides that every other aspect of the game is more or less annoying and feels like you are playing an alpha with no thought put into it.

Pro's are imo a good looking dystopian world. Night City is really worth seeing. That alone doesn't justify the purchase though.",False

You can easily spend several hours of your day doing side missions and time seemingly just seeps away right through the palms of your hands. In the first 7 days of owning the game i racked up 40 hours in it, i feel like that could give you a good idea on how enjoyable the game is when you first lay your hands on it.

In a time like this, where most people are sitting at home with nothing to do, this kind of escape really is very special. I would recommend this game twice if i could.

"elated and disappointed. ill explain elation first, the gunplay and combat is awesome, story is unique and interesting, environment assets look brilliant, animation is top notch. the scene based music is glorious. the weapons are creative. the dialog and hero characters are written quite well. 

( skip the bugs beating a dead whale imo )

now for disappointment, 

Story, the depth of story is not shallow but if you were expecting witcher 3 levels of quest length and its myriad of choice and consequences then understand that you will feel robbed of the experience what you wanted. I wont say anymore.

Features, most of the ripper doc features are anemic, only 1 interesting animation + scene for adding implants. never again will you be treated to glorious convo or scenes involving implants. the awesome user interface for the ripperdoc that's seen in the trailer was subject to devolution (reverted to witcher 2 ui). tech bots and personal drones are not a thing. the spider bot is a prop piece for 1 level.  firearm customization is minimized in that you may only craft firearms or melee arms from crafting recipes scattered around night city to pad out game time and to incentivize exploration of environment assets for the benefit of consumer screenshots that market the game on social media. The system for damage types for weapons is like adding world of warcraft buffs that only serve to show particle effects off. Vehicle customization is non existent, house/ apartment acquisition is none existent. Public transport like monorails, and subways is none existent. Stalls/shop interactions and animations are gone unless its side quest related. The character customization system has been downgraded drastically, the rpg element of this game has been surgically removed so that the illusion of consequences from decisions seem real on the first run. Second play through dispels this illusion. Mono wire does not hack anything. Invisibility has been cut. Pacifism is meaningless in the game, meaning it yields no consequences for the story. personal npc close up hacking is gone. Item or shard inspection is gone.

"Another great game from CDPR, as expected. A vast open world with branching storyline, a true RPG in FPP. Those negative review mostly coming from FPS player who thought this is their dystopian COD and butthurt who annoyed by the bug.

I don't really mind the bug as I know over time CDPR will solve the issue as what they did with TW3. Skyrim's bug in its early days was in another league but its still a great game.

"It feels like a mixture of pretty good games I've played through my life; feels like Borderlands here, GTA there, a tiny tad of E.Y.E.
There are a few bugs but none of those I encountered so far have disrupted anything. I've seen some stuff going through some walls or shit like that but that's it. 
Driving feels very clunky but I hope there'll be some sort of changes to that but it's not a big deal to me either.
Shooting felt a bit weird at first but after a few fights I've got pretty comfortable. It's enjoyable to experiment around with the many options you have for combat.
The customization is OK, implants are cool, upgrading and crafting is pretty neat, lets you chill with your favourite weapons without having them outdated an hour after finding them.
I'm kinda far from done with the main storyline but so far... So good. I'm really having a good time with it, some things are as predictable as your average movie/vidya but that doesn't mean it's bad. I get to know the characters well enough as to feel pissed or glad when something happens to them. 
Keanu Reeves is a neat man and his characters are great, I'm not a fanboy but I sure do love his shooting range skills, gotta respect the man and having him here is just... yea, neat.
I could go on and on but I'm far from done with the game so this will do. You chaps reading this and still considering buying it, should buy it, the sixty bucks are milkable - no kidding.",True

"The year is 2077: Cars are extremely bouncy and everyone is terrified of you sliding down the sidewalk. 

Projekt Red's idea of a next generation FPS RPG is not so not next gen. Shootouts are duck'n'cover till you see the enemy's head pop out, stealth is cheesing braindead AI till you can walk behind them, hacking is sudoku, and civilian AI are about as dumb as you can get (they seem less intelligent than GTA V's AI). The graphics are good if you have a PC with the right horsepower, but they're nothing SUPER CRAZY NEXT GENERATION. 

However, Red did deliver with great storytelling. For once in an open world RPG of this caliber I am actually interested in playing Side missions. I beat Fallout 4 without ever touching an unnecessary mission and never looked back. When I beat CP77 I plan on replaying to experience the full scope of the story. Your dialogue choices do lead to different outcomes in missions and leveling your character/customizing your kit a certain way will affect how you interact with each quest. 

CP77 also has good character writing. While not exceptional at all times; I do feel a connection with the story, the characters I interact with and the choices I make. Some characters are really lame though. Johnny Silverhand, (Keanu Reeve's Character), is crap. Despite being a legendary super-terrorist he's an actual DUMB-ASS, super arrogant, and carries himself like an intolerant manchild. And since he's such an integral part of the story; it's sad to be left this completely unrelatable and annoying character to deal with. He's the embodiment of edgy, hot topic teenage angst oh my lord it makes me cringe. 

This game is not flawless; I don't necessarily think its revolutionary in any way or worthy of the intense hype that surrounded it since announcement. But; its still a solid singleplayer game, and I certainly had fun playing it. It's easy to get sucked in and playing for hours despite it's flaws (BrainDances are really boooooorrinnggg, inventory management is annoying, other issues are meh). If you liked GTA V, Skyrim, Fallout, The Witcher; you'll probably enjoy this. IMO, this one is definitely better than the other four. I would give this a Strong 7/10.

I am sure that with time and updates from CDPR, this will become a great game with decent performance, but having bought it on day one, I am extremely disappointed with this game.

"[h1]LONG REVIEW: TL;DR BENEATH[/h1]

[i]At this point in the game I am 19hrs in, and have finished the main campaign, with very little attention to side missions and content. I will update my review once I have completed a portion of side content in the future. I will also keep spoilers behind spoiler tags. This will be a long review as there is a lot to cover, but I will try to be as punctual as possible.[/i]

[b]TL;DR: Cyberpunk 2077 is an enjoyable experience with an immersive world and rich story. However, the combat, driving and other mechanics are rather flawed at a technical level in their current state. Did I think it lived up to its hype? Probably not. Is it worth playing at its current price? If you are willing to look past the bugs, sure. If you have any doubts about the game after watching footage, I would wait a significant amount of time before considering purchasing the game.[/b]

[i]Although my review will contain a lot of criticism, I want to preface that I wholeheartedly enjoyed playing this game and do intend to play it again soon. The criticism I feel, should be interpreted as constructive, and hopefully CDPR take appropriate steps to make this game closer to the intended product.[/i]

[hr][/hr]

[h1]THE STORY[/h1]
Cyberpunk 2077 provides an immersive insight into a corporate-ran world within the Cyberpunk genre. The story places you in the role of the character V, who is a mercenary residing within Night City, and can take contracts for a variety of 'fixers' around the city [Note that character customisation for V is severely limited and cannot be changed after completion to my understanding (haircuts and surgery do not exist)]. At the start of the game you select one of three backstories (Nomad, Street Kid, Corpo), which provide a 10-20 minute intro which eventually reaches the same point in the story regardless of the start choice. The only major differences this decision makes are the occasional dialogue option based off your background, and some NPC interactions, though I didn’t explore the latter as much. In terms of other decisions the game offers you, CDPR stays true to their narrative style of the Witcher 3, where your choices, specifically in side-quests, will have a major impact on the outcome of the game. Although I probably achieved one of the worse endings by sticking to the main questline, I have seen other players gain the trust of various characters and secured their help in the penultimate quests of the game. It is worth noting that the story is very dialogue heavy, and you will be spending a large proportion of playtime talking with other characters.

[h1]THE SETTING[/h1]
Night City is amazing to look at on high & ultra graphics settings but does not resemble the footage that CDPR have posted prior to the game's official release. Textures occasionally bugged out, breaking immersion at times, but for the most part, could be overlooked. Crowds were large enough on max density and had a variety of appearances. NPCs would often bug out, however, and felt weaker and less immersive than those of a game such as GTA V. The map is welcomingly large, with the entirety of Night City, and well as the desert-like Badlands surrounding the city, to explore.

[h1]COMBAT[/h1]
Combat in Cyberpunk is fun for the most part, gunplay in particular feels rewarding enough for an RPG game. Weapons and gear use a DPS-based system with rarities, similar to a game like Borderlands. Speaking of Borderlands, different weapons manufacturers have different traits on guns, for example, three types of weapons I encountered were power weapons (ballistic weapons which can ricochet), tech weapons (chargeable shots which can pierce walls, though these weapons from experience were a get of out jail free card in many situations), and smart weapons (auto tracking bullets, which required a cybernetic upgrade to your hands to use effectively). As such the variety of weapons was there, with customisable mods, attachments, and stats to boot. The game’s perk system could be somewhat compared to a Bethesda RPG, where you level a stat, and each stat has perks and attributes attached to it which you can individually upgrade. The stats in particular would passively buff your character and open up new dialogue options and interactables (for example, an upgraded ‘body’ stat allows V to intimidate NPCs in dialogue options, and pry open locked metal doors in the environment). Finally, stealth felt like a tacked on mechanic, with broken animations, and getting detected by one guard who you proceeded to neutralise would then alert everyone connected to his network, which seemed unforgiving for players who wished to take the meticulous, sneaky approach.

[h1]DRIVING & EXPLORATION[/h1]
Exploration of Night City was engaging and enjoyable, with very distinct areas on the map to enjoy. However, as the map is primarily a dense city, the areas aren’t as iconic as say, the cities and holds found within Skyrim. Driving is the primary method of getting around the map, but unfortunately, for keyboard & mouse players, you may find that the driving handles awfully. The cars and bikes can only really go from 0-100 on turning and acceleration, meaning you’re either not moving at all, or you’re struggling to drive properly.

 [h1]PERFORMANCE & IMMERSION [/h1]
Ok, so this is the issue most people have been having with the game at launch. I’m playing on an RTX 2080 Super, with similar specs to support it, and for the most part, the graphics look stunning and immersive, but the performance can vary. I’m often on a high framerate, but in some scenarios, typically while driving, I’ve noticed my framerate can drop massively. In terms of other bugs I have encountered, physics for ragdolling elements are frequently bugged, with characters getting trapped in surfaces while dead or even alive (the latter was a problem for the final boss in my playthrough, [spoiler]Adam Smasher, who was trapped in a balcony floor for the latter half of the fight, then after dying, sunk into the floor so I was only able to loot the keycard to enter the final room, obviously breaking immersion since he was hyped up throughout the game as the feared cyborg mercenary who killed Johnny Silverhand (the character played by Keanu Reeves)[/spoiler]). Animations are frequently problematic as well, with NPCs T-Posing even on save reloads, takedowns consistently attacking nothing, and dead bodies continuing to track the player character with their eyes, to name a few often occurring ones. Though these bugs made for some hilarious scenarios which kept me engaged, they broke immersion severely and removed any tension or stakes the plot was trying to build. Sound design was inherently flawed, with radios being absolutely silent (including vehicles), and other sounds totally missing (such as glass breaking).",True
"Its not the world ending game everyone expected, but it is a great single player game. Think Witcher 3 in first person with a Cyberpunk aesthetic. Thats about it.
I have a very strong PC and still it struggles, but I will say the graphics are amazing, for me.
There have been numerous graphical bugs, but nothing game breaking or game altering. 
The gunplay feels great, a lot better than I had expected.
As others have stated the story feels a little in your face, but if you take it slow, play the side quests and pay attention, its a fun, fast paced game. Its just not as slow and story driven as their past games (Witcher 3)
Vehicles feel sluggish like GTA5, but thats something devs have struggled with since the dawn of racing games.
Beautiful world, fun and interesting mechanics and small twists on typical FPS gameplay, IE Leaning, etc. 
8.5/10, not worth the insane hype, but definitely a fantastic game that I will lose many hours in im sure!

PS. Had issues with my save, almost lost my entire 20 hour save. Kept retrying every possible fix, nothing worked. Kept reloading my save for nearly 30minutes out of frustration and finally loaded... No issues since, but there are also no fixes for this issue it seems so be weary and have PLENTY of manual saves....",True

"There has been a lot of hyberbole flying around related to this game, positive and negative, both before and after launch. 

Stepping outside all that, as a big fan of all 3 Witcher games, I was pretty satisfied with what I got here. The strengths (characters, story and world) are all pretty much in line with what I loved about previous games from the studio. The story and characters are strong, and Night City is among the most impressivly detailed urban open worlds in gaming. 

The gameplay side of things is good enough to be enjoyable, though certainly outclassed by other games. There are good options for playstyles that provide more variety in character builds than the Witcher games. The biggest drawbacks are the well documented technical issues, with inconsistent and buggy enemy AI being the worst offender. 

I was fairly fortunate in my playthrough with bugs, encountering only minor issues, at worst having to reload a save on a couple of occasions. However, minor glitches and some rather broken systems like the cops still break immersion with some regularity. 

Between the bugs and performance issues, waiting a few months for patches is likely a good idea, but if you've enjoyed CD Projekts previous work, Cyberpunk 2077 is well worth playing.",True
"Well, After 8 years of waiting for this game, I ended up going for a 100% playthrough. It took me 63 hours on the Normal difficulty, and I've fully 100% the game. Nothing left for me to do. All Main and Side misisons are done. All vehicles are purchased, every gig and scanner hustle completed, all tarot cards claimed. Nothing left for me to do.

After waiting 8 years, this game is somewhat of a disappointment, the AI is terrible, It's got bugs out of the wazoo. 

Never have I see a game go mass exodus and give refunds out left and right for being so broken.

This game from me, gets a 7/10 and thats at a push.

I just can't bring myself to start that second playthrough I had planned, let alone the third, not until the game is fixed.

So for now, i'll recommend it only for those die hard fans out there, or those that enjoy a story and can over look all the issues. Otherwise, you should simply wait, not for a sale, but for CDPR to finish what they started.",True

I will say that they could've waited probably an extra month or so to polish up some of the bugs instead of dropping it and letting us find the bugs for them but none the less I've yet to run into any game breaking bugs or soft locks in my playthrough. Overall I'd give the game a 8/10, not nine out of ten because of the bugs atm but I'm sure they will  all be fixed through time.",True

"I guess I'll start by saying that the console version not working is unacceptable and that should be fixed asap. That's not what my thoughts here are referring to. My one sentence review would be ""If you have a decent PC then this game is definitely worth it."" That being said I'll list the rest of my thoughts below. This is how I feel after 30 hours. i'm almost done with the main story.

Tech Stuff/Graphics: Cyberpunk had a bit of a PR nightmare surrounding its launch. I watched a lot of reviews after it came out and there were a lot of valid complaints. I admittedly don't understand any frames per second/ray-tracing jargon a lot of the more tech savvy people reviewers throw around. I let the computer decide what was acceptable in that area and the game looked fantastic. The game never crashed and any bugs I encountered did not affect the flow of the game. I did hear of a bug that may delete all of my progress once the save file is bigger than 8 MB, but as of now that hasn't happened. (If it did happen I'd be pretty upset)

Story: I'm the kind of guy who skips the story in 90% of video games I play. I find it harder to care about the story as I get older because I don't have much time to play games. But in this game I was unable to bring myself to skip the story because its really good. Its like watching a really good Netflix series. There is an interesting cast of characters and you get to make a lot of meaningful choices. There were also plenty of opportunities for your character's build to affect the outcome of conversations. I keep getting caught up in side quests because there are so many characters I want to know more about. The story is probably the best thing Cyberpunk has going for it. 

Gameplay: Cyberpunk reminds me a lot of the Fallout/Elder Scrolls games. If you like those games you'll definitely like this. One gripe I have in any game like this is the insistence on me sneaking around. I like to go in guns blazing, but being sneaky always seems to be the default. It irks me when I get a ""NICE GOING IDIOT!"" for playing the way I want to play. (This isn't specific to Cyberpunk, a lot of games are guilty of this) The quick hack system allows for some fun combat. I like poisoning guys, blowing up stuff or any other havoc I could cause mid combat. I played a sub-machine gun/blades/quick hack build which ended up being really fun. I also enjoyed wandering around the world. There were a lot of ads, people, places, and decor that culminated in the game being pretty immersive. It all felt pretty plausible. I felt like the driving was pretty clunky compared to other games I've played, but I'm generally a bad video game driver. There were also a lot of ""brain dance"" editing sequences which got old. I would have to find a particular item/sound which wasn't immediately obvious and they wont let you continue without finding it. It really slowed the pace of the game a couple times. I am still having a lot of fun though and plan on finishing the game.  

Sound: The music was all really cool. I kept it on the smooth jazz station (Royal something or other) pretty much the whole game. There was a pretty cool black metal station (Ritual FM) too. I heard complaints about Keanu Reeves performance, but I thought it was totally fine. All of the voice acting was really well done. 

I hope this helps. I also hope whomever can't play the game, gets it fixed because it would be a shame to miss out on this one because of the terrible launch. I'm sure it will be 20 bucks and run great in a couple years, so waiting is a good option too.",True
"It's been known to be stuck in development hell for a while, and as such I set my expectations accordingly. As such, I got an unfinished game as expected - and I still like it.

Buggy and messy, a solid main story, and a big open world. As with comparing Witcher 3 day 1 to Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in 2020, I doubt they'll leave it in this state and patch up all the missing components.

No Mans Sky failed harder than this at launch and they've recovered it into a great game, and I hope to see the same here.

"After playing around 40 hours of this game, here are some of my thoughts. (*SPOILER FREE*)

Pros:
-Excellent graphic (i have it on medium setting still looks magnificent)
-Tons but i really mean TONS of side missions
-Every side mission experienced like it could be the in main mission (really high quality) 
-Driving feels solid 
-The writing of the story is outstanding
-Night city feels alive
-You are going to feel the connection with the charaters
-Keanu Reeves is a f*cking treasure 

Cons:
-Small bugs here and there (nothing game breaking)
-Really hardware heavy (I'm playing on i5-9600KF with 16GB RAM and GTX 1070 and i get average 50 fps on Medium-Low setting) 
-In need some quality of life updates 
-No character customization after the start (not even hair style)
-No vehicle customization
-The keybinds feels a little bit awkward

Overall this game is very soild in almost every single aspect, just needs some small tweaks here and there.
I would highly recommend it!

"There's no way this was going to work out perfectly. At around 30 hours, I don't want to play this any more. It's not only the lack of open-world features, it's not the lack of physicality and realism, it's also the lackluster story being told. Nothing feels particularly grounded.. like, why even finish this review",False
"First off, yes this game was released before it was ready and there are a LOT of bugs. I still managed to complete the main campaign despite this but I did so with a ridiculous bug that caused me to be naked (with no genitals) from the waist down for the entire ending section of the campaign, despite apparently having clothing equipped.  

This is where I found my biggest disappointment with this game; the bugs took me out of the immersion of the experience and having to complete a large portion of the main campaign half naked was ridiculous. 

Overall the story and game world are amazing though but again due to the unfinished state some aspects of the story were a bit broken or felt unfinished. 

The graphics are obviously amazing and with Ray Tracing enabled it really looks stunning. That being said, I played with RT off as the hit on my FPS with it on didn't justify using it and the game still looks great without RT. I don't think any current gen graphics card can truly run this game maxed out at playable frame rates, so you will need to play around with settings to get decent performance. 

Overall I really enjoyed the gun play in particular, though I did like how you can progress your character with upgrades it didn't feel like this had much impact on the overall outcome. I can understand those who had expectations of something deeper than Deus X feeling disappointed but I had no expectations beyond a lot of bugs. You can approach missions with stealth and hacking or brute force but due to the flaky stealth system I found myself resorting to shooting my way through objectives - which I enjoy anyway but others may find this disappointing. There doesn't seem to be any benefit to using stealth either and I must say that early on I didn't bother upgrading my character or spending skill points and it didn't seem to hinder me too much. 

In summary, this game could have been released as one of the all time greats. We know CDPR can produce quality and if you haven't tried Witcher 3 I would probably hold off on this for a few months and play Witcher 3 now, since that game is complete and not full of bugs. 

Its a crying shame this game was released in an unready state, it deserved so much better as the scope and potential of what they did here is still impressive. 

I recommend it, though I would wait for a few months of bug fixes and patches",True
"Best RPG ever made is here, at the tip of your fingers! Play it Samurai! We have a city to burn!",True
"This game has so many bugs, missing features, lack of depth, and is overall extremely disappointing.
I am aware bugs can and will happen because you can never really account for every single thing a player will do in the game. However, for some reason, the roles of the player and bugs have been reversed and you can never really account for what will break because it happens so randomly and it takes you right out of the experience.

Features that were advertised as a selling point in the game are straight up missing. Life paths are completely pointless and only affect the first 20 minutes and not the rest of the game as advertised. Some guy calculated that about 99.7% of the game's choices just don't matter at all (which I fully believe, as I've tried to change the story path several times)

Cops just spawn in and they don't even bother chasing you when you run, Character Customization was disappointing (but this is just personal preference), most of the time buildings are completely inaccessible(despite being advertised as a nowhere-you-can't-go type of game).

This game just severely disappointed me, and I really hope they can fix all this and more in the future, because I sank 60 dollars into this game that I cannot get back and I had expected much more from this game and this company.

As of right now, I do not recommend it. I'll update my review when all the fixes come through.",False
"Here it is, ladies and gentlemen. Our 8 years long waiting is over. [b]Cyberpunk 2077[/b] is finally here. And... it turned out to be a disappoint. Pretty big one too. Well, if you're a console player, you can actually call it a full scale disaster thanks to completely broken ports, which, at the moment I write this, were even pulled from [b]PS Store[/b], [i]but[/i] console ports are different story. Here and now I want to talk about [b]PC[/b] version and [b]PC[/b] version alone. Just because... you know. [b]Steam[/b] reviews have character limit, so... yeah. No matter what you do, [i]do not[/i] pay for console version. But here, in [b]Steam[/b], I'll share my thoughts on [b]PC[/b] release.

Like I said, this game is a big disappoint. For years we've followed [b]CD Projekt[/b]'s updates and dreamed about perfect cyberpunk experience. And what did we get in the end? Well, pretty much nothing, really. The funniest thing about [b]Cyberpunk 2077[/b] is that there's close to no gameplay in it. Simple like that. If you've expected an [b]RPG[/b] experience, you should forget about it long before starting with this game. It is [i]not[/i] an [b]RPG[/b]. Not that [b]CD Projekt[/b] promised us an [b]RPG[/b] (feel free to check the official description in [b]Steam[/b], the game is advertised as “open world action-adventure”), but still, quite a lot of people expected a cyberpunk take on good ol' [b]Witcher 3[/b]. While this game? It is [i]not[/i] a [b]Witcher[/b]. Long story short, it's a first-person shooter with cars that takes place in an open world environment and is mixed with choose-your-own-adventure-like elements. That's pretty much it.

Not like the formula is a big problem by itself. Quite the opposite. I found it quite nice. I mean, why bloody not, right? Everybody loved [b]Deus Ex[/b] series. Why not to give us an action-packed version of it in a proper open world environment? I mean, technically, [b]Mankind Divided[/b] was an open world game too, but, let's just face it, the open world there was just a gimmick. So, action-oriented [b]Deus Ex[/b] with a proper open world? Sounds good to me. And even though a huge cyberpunk [b]RPG[/b] still sounds like a beautiful dream, it's not like we didn't have any choices in [b]Deus Ex[/b], while this game adds to the formula by including as many of such choices as possible. So, what's wrong here? Why all the disappointment? Let me explain.

First, for a [b]$314.000.000[/b] game it's... laughably rough and unpolished. The action parts feel like a cheap second-grade [b]FPS[/b], while driving... *sigh* Yeah, about bloody driving... Let's just say you won't be able to use cars in the city without suffering. Outside the city? No problem. Feel free to have fun with your wheels there. Because there's nobody there. But in the city itself? It's better to either walk or use the quick travel. Why? Because you touch anything - you instantly get wanted status. Which means that suddenly there'll be an army of cops shooting at you. And since it's yet another one of those games, in which [b]AI[/b] is a suicidal maniac and pretty much everybody would try to jump in front of your car... Like I said. Cars? City? NO!

But even that isn't the biggest problem. We've seen rough. We've survived the bloody [b]S.T.A.L.K.E.R.[/b]! Sure we can deal with [b]Cyberpunk[/b]. The real problem is - there isn't much to do here. Like, at all. You either do quests, or... well, that's pretty much it. Sure, there are optional activities here. But [i]all of them[/i] are the... same... exact... thing. Simple like that. You enter the zone and either kill somebody, or access the computer. For the experience. Repeat until out of patience. That's it. Nothing else here. No even proper collectibles. Well, aside from a deck of tarot cards, but those hardly feel like the real deal. Not like I miss all that collectible disaster from the [b]Assassin's Creed[/b] series, but honestly, [b]Night City[/b] is so empty that you'll want to cry. Remember how many stuff [b]GTA[/b] series had? Well, forget about that. Here you can't even change your appearance. You're done choosing your genitals (which is a thing now) at the beginning – that's it. No barber shops, no tattoo salons (even though there [i]is[/i] a way to apply a couple of tattoos as some sort of reward), no gang wars (you can't even join a faction properly), [i]nothing[/i]. [b]Night City[/b] is just that – a bunch of story missions. End of the story. Should I say that it sucks? I mean, seriously. [b]$314.000.000[/b] for a pretty basic choose-your-own-adventure experience? How? [i]Why?![/i] I smell some serious bull here. I really wonder if [b]Adam Kiciński[/b] and [b]Randy Pitchford[/b] are friend now. Because that's how it feels here. Seriously, [i]what did they do with all the money?![/i] I mean, aside from paying [b]Keanu[/b].

That's where things starting to feel good, though. Because story in this game? It's a bloody masterpiece. And even though usually I'm a [b]John Carmack[/b] kind of guy who believes that story in games isn't really that important, I totally had a blast with [b]Cyberpunk[/b]. Unlike [b]Witcher 3[/b], character here don't waste your time talking about nothing. Sure, they'll still talk quite a lot, but the writing here is so rich and full of details that it feels... [i]awesome[/i]. I didn't feel so personally involved with the characters since [b]Detroit: Become Human[/b]. When you play [b]Cyberpunk[/b]? It's just... impossible not to care. And since no matter what you'll do, there won't be perfect ending for everybody, the impact is even bigger. Like [b]Detroit[/b], [b]Cyberpunk[/b] makes you think about it for quite some time after you finish it. Which will take up to [b]100[/b] hours but only if you're up for [b]100%[/b] completion with all the achievements. If all you want is a main storyline, it'll be, like, [b]50[/b] hours.

Trust me, though, you'll want to do optional quests. I mean, quests, not those crappy “activities”. The optional quests here? They're at least as good as the main story. Some of them are even better, actually. So nicely written, so full of details, so perfectly directed... Awesome stuff. It's just... those don't really feel like optional stuff. Especially since they're directly connected to the choices you'll have at the end. In other words, optional quests are not... really... optional. Awesome. But not optional.

Unfortunately, like I said, aside from those quests, [b]Night City[/b] can't offer you anything. Literally. Anything. Aside from unpolished [b]FPS[/b] sequences. Open world here? It's a gimmick. No proper [b]RPG[/b] experience, no proper exploration, no proper activities... Like I said, this game has nothing. Only some shooting and some basic choose-your-own-adventure-like choices. That's it. That's the entire game. Unlike many others, I didn't experience a single major bug during my playthrough (was playing since the moment the game was launched) and [i]man[/i], does it look breathtaking (even though the optimization is horrible, the game comes with some brilliant textures, fantastic [b]HDR[/b] and beautiful ray tracing), but... let's just admit it. Eight years... [b]$314.000.000[/b]... [b]Keanu Reeves[/b]... Something this basic is not what we all expected.

So, I don't know. I don't want to give this game a thumb down. Just because personally? Well, I loved it. Here. Said it. Even though I don't have tendency to treat video game characters like real people, the characters in [b]Cyberpunk 2077[/b] became, like, a family to me. The writing in [b]Cyberpunk[/b] is [i]that[/i] awesome. And I sure treasure my memories here. But when it's about gameplay? [b]Cyberpunk 2077[/b] is a rough, shallow, empty and overall disappointing game. Remember the first [b]Xenus[/b] (AKA [b]Boiling Point: Road to Hell[/b])? Add godlike writing and that'll be it. So, at the end of the day, I have only one question - [i]what did they do with the bloody money?!![/i]",True
"I had a hard time deciding whether I should give this a positive or a negative review, but ultimately it’s a negative review due to my disappointment. 

TL;DR: I’d recommend buying it on sale late next year, once it’s patched and cheaper. It’s a decent GTA-style game with stats in a cyberpunk setting, but not a deep role-playing game with player choice that they pitched it as. It’s disappointing & it’s a huge shame, because there aren’t many AAA cRPG games based on tabletop paper rpgs. I had high hopes, but this one’s not one of them either. I don’t usually write long reviews, unless I’m massively disappointed. I mostly just played through the main story with some side content here and there. I'll keep playing it from time to time because I like the cyberpunk genre. I'll probably return to do all available content, once the game is patched. Side content won't change the issues I have with this game, so I feel my experience is still valid.

It’s a buggy game, but that’s understandable with a huge open-world game. Bugs are not why this is a negative review. 

“Style over substance” - a perfect description of what this game’s like, taken straight from the rulebook of the pen and paper rpg. Yes, this game is based on the Cyberpunk 2020 & Red tabletop rpgs, but the developer’s ambition was to make a story-rich, deep & meaningful rpg. Cyberpunk 2077 sounds and looks great, but it’s incredibly shallow & ironically on par with the tabletop game’s motto. 


Narrative-wise it’s extremely derivative of cyberpunk classics, it’s especially visible when you compare it to William Gibson’s Neuromancer. Paying tribute and inserting nods to works of media that established what is cyberpunk as a genre is one thing. However, CP2077’s main themes and story beats (especially in the first half) share a lot of similarities with Neuromancer to the point it felt like I was playing a version of that novel. I really wish parts of the story were more original with more nuanced themes and commentary on the world in 2077. 

The story felt fairly predictable a lot of times, but it has its interesting moments and some memorable characters like Jackie, Judy & Panam. Writing is a mixed bag and some quests feel like unnecessary filler. 

There are many instances where you travel with your companions in a car to your destination.  Many rpgs have idle chatter to make travel time with companions more interesting and serve a worldbuilding purpose. Here, you say a few sentences and for the remaining 70% of the trip to your destination it’s literally silence. It’s good there’s an option to skip the ride. Really makes you think this game is unfinished and content that should have been there is nowhere to be found. 

Character creator is decent as far as options go. You can choose a “life path” that will supposedly have an impact on the story and your available choices. Think of it as the origins in Dragon Age or classes in rpgs. This is also just a facade - life paths don’t matter, aside from the special intros and lifepath-specific dialogue option here and there (mostly optional blue ones), they have no impact that you'd expect from supposedly a rich choice-driven rpg. 

Within many dialogues in the main story, you typically have a choice of a single yellow dialogue line to advance and a few blue ones that are optional that contain more information. There’s almost no player agency or choices to make within the narrative. Games like Pillars of Eternity 2, Baldur’s Gate 3, Wasteland 3 or Divinity Original Sin 2 have expansive storylines with a massive amount of dialogue and actual varied choices. Those games had an infinitely smaller budget compared to CP2077. This is a 3D AAA game, so I don’t expect as many dialogue lines as in those games, but choice here is non-existent. I’d argue that even Deus Ex Human Revolution from 2011 is much more a choice-driven cyberpunk RPG than this. In the short intro mission in Human Revolution I felt like I had more choice than throughout most of CP2077.  Act 1 felt close to what they presented in the marketing and I wish the whole game had that level of choice. 

Let’s talk about the RPG aspect while we’re at it. This game feels like Fallout 4, but with a bit more character build options or you can think of it as GTA with stats and skill points. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, and the gameplay is quite fun. I like the exploration and the combat is meaty. However, it’s definitely not what it was originally pitched as. If you’re looking for lengthy dialogues with a lot of narrative options, choices and player agency in a cyberpunk setting, play any Shadowrun game from Harebrained Schemes. 

I often had a feeling that they really just wanted to make a first person shooter in a cyberpunk setting. This is especially evident in sequences where you play as Silverhand. Your gun does crazy damage and you’re nearly invincible. It’s designed that way on purpose, but why not just make an FPS and stop pretending this is a choice-driven rpg. It feels like this game was rebooted at some point and scaled down, once they realized it would be too ambitious and time consuming. Marketing should have changed too, instead they kept pushing this as a revolutionary cRPG. 

It really does feel like within the 8 year dev time, they could have made 2 fun FPS games telling stories from the Cyberpunk 2020/Red universe. Instead it seems a ton of time and effort was wasted, because it looks as if they themselves had trouble establishing what this game should be. The above is obviously all just speculation on my part, but it’s evident that the game’s development was terribly managed and content and ideas were scrapped during production to push it out faster. A large part of this was confirmed through investigative reports on CDPR and CP2077’s troubled development history. 

This is not a terrible video game - sound design and graphics are great, the size and scope of the city is impressive and the moment to moment gameplay is quite fun. It’s just a shame it's wasted on a mediocre story that's very derivative and boils down to ""wow, cool future"" instead of providing a meaningful narrative. I guess we should have expected it, since the pen and paper rpg's motto is ""style over substance"" that I mentioned previously. 

All in all, this is a massive disappointment, since it was marketed as a rich, deep & choice-driven RPG and it turned out to be a shallow GTA clone in a cyberpunk setting. I’ll repeat it again, this is not a bad game. I enjoyed parts of it and I will probably play more of it, especially next-year once it’s fully patched, because I like open-world games. However, it doesn’t change the fact that this game has a lot of problems, ones that can’t be patched or easily changed without a massive rework. Wait for a sale late next year once it’s fully patched and you’ll find a decent GTA/Fallout 4 style game here with a massive amount of content that can provide a good amount of fun. 

Important side note: 
It’s worth noting that this game & the studio that made it are problematic and should be rightfully criticized for some of their content & actions. CP2077 was highly mismanaged, which is clear when you realize this is what we got after 8 years of development. You can find investigative reports on the internet of toxic work culture and massive crunch. While it’s an industry-wide problem, dev exploitation should not be excused. The studio & the game have a history of transphobia, racism & sexualization among other problematic situations & content Steam has a character limit for reviews & I had to cut down my review but it's all easily available on the web in good articles with critical analysis on Polygon, Waypoint, ResetEra, Bloomberg or Fanbyte among some of the sites.",False
"Disappointment, the game. Didn't live to a fraction of the expectations that were created before release, not to mention that it's riddled with bugs, crashes, and general and performance issues.
You can still have fun, as I did, but it's the same type of fun you get from iddle activities in other open world games that have been around for years at this point, and with a fraction of the problems.
Honestly let down by CDPR, and don't recommend purchasing this game until it's had a large number of updates to fix the mess it is.",False
"I've found Cyberpunk 2077 a very rich environment to play and get lost in. Is it a perfect game? No, but I have full confidence it will be in time. There are a lot of changes and updates that need to take place. Remember back to when the Witcher 3 launched. It wasn't the polished masterpiece people try to remember it as. However, in time it (the Witcher 3) became one of the best games ever published. I can't wait to see what updates, fixes and additions will be made to Cyberpunk 2077. Play it on PC and optimize the video settings for your particular rig. Do this and be richly rewarded with a fun game that isn't trying to nickle and dime you.",True
"Good game but there are clearly way too many bugs at launch. The AI is completely broken, you cannot stealth through the game due to the fact that you get spotted through walls. Certain events don't trigger and required me to reload saves to trigger the cutscenes.

"Updated review. 

I enjoyed this game. It's buggy as hell, obviously. Unless you live under a rock you've seen the news by now surrounding this game. But the attention to detail is certainly there. There are a lot of bugs to be squashed, and a lot of things that should be added. (more melee kill animations, perhaps even a revamped melee system. Better driving AI. Better civilian AI. Random world connections such as factions coming after you when you kill a lot of them and them noticing it, putting reports on you, etc.) 

That being said, there *is* love in this game. It may need a lot more, but it's there. Give this title 6 months, a year from release. Come back and have a look at it.",True
"Honestly. I love the game. It runs like a dream and I've had the fortune to not run into many bugs, and have only dealt with a single, light crash. It's optimized quite well, at least for my specs.

However. I cannot in good faith recommend this game for full price, at the time of writing this, though granted, that is subject to change, as I continue to play the game.

My problems with this game, are simple. It's unpolished, and not enough for what we thought we were gonna get over the years. The character creation screen leaves a lot to be desired. It gives a bit of bang, but not a lot for the buck, especially since I believe skyrim's character creator, would look 10 times better then this, if it was released yesterday, and not however many years it's been.

Animations look great in cutscenes or face to face talks, and weapons details, but everywhere else they feel boring, and choppy, and given the least amount of love they could be given. Especially for that whole grab and takedown for sneaking. It looks like shit when it comes to that, to be perfectly honest.

The AI is meh, overall, and there's a lot left to be desired. Especially to police, who when coming after you to a bounty, will spawn about 15 feet away, in droves, and beat the dogshit out of you, and almost rarely lose sight, due to super fast police drones.

The story and side quests, don't give you many side entrances, or alternate, peaceful ways in, as far as I've seen. No side quest I've done so far has lead down any extensive path, and has never had any actual talking to people, aside from on the phone. No bribing a guard to leave, no peaceful way of settling a problem aside from sneaking your way through, and god forbid if you want to do this game non lethal, cause there's no real easy way of going about that, without making it a slog.

I'd give this game a solid low 6/10. You might ask why that still gets a negative review, and not a positive? Purely because we were promised a lot more, and I don't think we really received even half of that. I expected better CDPR, and I really do hope you improve on this, more then it is now.",False
"No. 
I've had to reload the game from saves countless times to stop an NPC glitch. 


That is dumb. Game should have been delayed another couple months for simple stuff. It might be good in a year or more. I honestly can't believe this is the game they give us.",False
"UPDATE: finally finished my character. Heard some cool things about this ""Johnny"" guy. Let's see.

Time to spend 100 hours on character customization.",True
"Most regretful game I have bought, would have loved a refund for it. Bad Acting and mechanics along with bugs. Don't recommend.",False
"Can't recommend it. Even if all the bugs were fixed, it would still be a very shallow game overall.

Buy it in 2 years at 75% off with all DLC included if you must.",False
"Cyberpunk2077 is.. hard to discuss.

Sadly I am plagued with bugs but I am looking forward to them being patched.

Forgot something to say. 
Even though the bugs might .. interrupt ur joy.. the story..
To cut things short:
The story will break ur heart, not only once, not only twice. 
It was one of the best stories I've ever played and witnessed, so do me, the random person that wrote the message, the favour to enjoy it.

                                                     PROS and CONS
______________________________________________________________


Biggest pros by far -

The story: As I said.. Storywise- one of the best stories I've ever been witnessing. Multiple endings, heart -breaking. (Hehe.. get it? I love Keanu.)

The fucking. Music.: Let's also cut this short. If u are a person with a little bit of emotions, there will flood tears out of ur eyes. The music is one of the biggest part to it. It's beautiful, wonderful.

Pros - 
The graphical aspect: Absolutely gorgeous. 

Characters: So different. Some are lovely, cute, adorable. Others are the way they're supposed to be. U feel when a character actually is a piece of shit.
U start to feel the way ur character does pretty early and feel sad.. pretty early, too.

Night City: Night city is such a beautiful city to explore. U will never skip a ride. In fact: U'll watch out of the window. The whole, fucking, ride.

Skill-tree: I am still busy with my first character 80 hours in game and went for a meleeish build. U probably heard about it: At the beginning it feels weak, but when u level up ur character, it starts to feel satisfying. 
As I said: I am just sitting on my melee build, yet I can tell: There should be a build for anyone and everyone. 

Implants: Implants will help you with ur build. For an all-in build, u might love to go for lil' rocket launcher in ur arms. For a melee-blade build, u might love to upgrade ur arms with blades coming out of 'em. There are a lot of implants makin ur character unique. 

Playtime: As I mentioned.. With my first character I am in the game for about 80 hours right now. Though I played through the endings the last 2 days, I am still not done. There is so much to do in this game, so ye. Hope ur able to enjoy it!

______________________________________________________________


Cons -

Bugs, bugs and bugs: Well... ye. Obviously, I am going to talk about them, too.
In this state, there are bugs. Not a few, but many. It's most likely that u will encounter them even in ur first minute of character creation. At release day, I was so hyped. I started the character creation and well.. After 30 min I still werent done. Why? Because I had to restart the game twice because of its buggy menu.
If u encounter the bug in ur character creation, where ur cursor keeps resetting to the top of the menu, try to plug in an controller and plug it out again. Should help.
Well, a ""short"" list of bugs I encountered so far in just one, single, mission:

- Characters clipping through walls
- Characters just disappeared
- Characters holding their weapons wrong
- No facial animations when talking
- Vehicles (Mission Vehicle) teleporting from place to place and almost gets stuck

Those are as I said just a few of the bugs I had in one single mission.

In free roaming it is worse, doe.

- Vehicles spawning inside of urs.
- Characters and Vehicles look like they came straight outta Runescape.
- Civilisation just starts to be gone.. until u hop out of ur vehicle, of course <.<
- Getting stuck beneath ur car after leaving it
and a lot more, sadly.

Graphics and Performance: Though I said that this game looks gorgeous, it comes with a lot of problems. Performance-wise, it's miserable. And a another tip for u.. if u have a problem with ur reflections, like.. weird looking dots in the reflections, turn off ""Screen Space Reflections"". I had that problem. After I turned that off.. god dayum, did it look smooth.
Another big problem about the graphics: Some textures tend to.. look bad in distance while some other textures look crystal clear next to it. Very bad. Especially vehicles. In some parts u think for urself: Damn, lets take a nice look at the city. Oh.. The bridge looks.. awful.. Oh my god.. are these.. 2d vehicles???
Yep, there are 2d vehicles. It DID hurt when I saw these. I mean it. It really did hurt. 

Character-Customization: Well, I can't rant about the customization. Before its release, hope's were bigger for me, to be honest. Don't get me wrong: It is not bad at all, yet after reading messages like ""U even can change ur teeth, I will sit there for 24 hours creating my char"". 
Obviously, that's not CD Projekts fault, but I would have wished for more options. (Well, to be honest, I am a maniac when it comes to character customization anyways)

Character-Customization-Ig: U've got implants.. and.. armor.. which u have to change.. nearly every minute.. That's it.. No hair stylist, no tattoos (except for some in the place of ur implants). Well, I hope there will come some updates for that.

Gun-play: The times I had a gun in my hands, felt clunky. Might change that with a different path skillwise, but don't know that for sure right now.

______________________________________________________________

Right now, that's everything I got to say about Cyberpunk. I am looking forward to CD Projekt fixing all these bugs, improving the performance and damn I hope for a way to customize ur character in game.


Overall I am disappointed, yet I am so happy I got to play this game (besides being depressed because of the hard-hitting-ending, no cap) and being able to see what the future brings us",True

"A deeply average RPG.

The same game made by a different pedigree would be largely ignored.

5/10 would refund if I could.",False
"Disappointing, even to someone with tempered expectations 

I really hate having to write this review as I was really excited for this game, but keep in mind, I did NOT want this game to be Grand Theft Auto 7 and cure cancer and Covid-19 while also getting my a girlfriend. What I DID expect was a solid RPG with interesting decisions where I can be who I want to be, have dynamic interesting combat, and a deep engaging world, and make decision that matter, essentially I wanted this to be a sexier New Vegas/Fallout 3 with a Cyberpunk theme and paintjob, not that much to ask imo. What I got was a buggy mess that feels more busy than anything else. Other reviews have already given great criticsm to this game but here's some of my largest complaints thus far (keep in mind I just got to the Johnny Silverhand part)

-The story feels tired, it started off strong enough but quickly feels like the writing is on par with the best of a Fallout 4 quest (with even less decision making since the dialogue is worse).
-The dialogue options may as well not even exist, you almost never have decisions and when you do they feel like a different way to get to the same point, but disguises it as a ""lifestyle option"" to make you feel like you're playing an actual engaging RPG where builds matter.
-The combat has potential to at least be servicable, without getting to spoiler heavy theres a scripted segment where your gunshots basically 1 shot enemies and the combat feels extremely satisfying there. Sadly, thats a one off and for most of the game you are gonna find yourself going against bullet sponge enemies with braindead AI and UI clutter that makes every engagement make you feel less of a badass gun for hire you has control of a situation and more like a confused bullet dispenser
-The bugs...enough said 
-Stealth is an actual joke, it's about as barebones as a AAA shooter game from the early 360 era as it gets and feels more like a tacked on feature for advertising and to add another skill tree - which btw are nothing special. They're the typical skill trees where the first few perks of each stat actually make a large difference and the rest are all just % changes that woulnd't even matter if the enemies weren't so bullet spongey 
-The law enforcement is hilariously bad. Its worse than GTA3's cops. I punched a random cop in the face and suddenly 4 well armed cyberguys materialized in front of me and filled me with lead, its awful
-The UI, while stylized is very cluttered and overwhelming and genuinely gives me a headache
-And lastly some parts, bugs aside, just feel unfinished, the game LITERALLY doesn't have water physics. Even WATCH DOGS LEGION, which got meme'd for the shit water showed splashes when you shot it, not in ""the next generation of open world RPG's"" tho baby!

The biggest issue with Cyberpunk is that the advertisement blatantly lied hype aside and that it brings nothing new to the table that makes me want to play it. Here's what I mean:

-Would I play it for the stealth? 
    -Hell no, I could just play MGS5, Dishonered, AC Origins, or Hitman
-Would I play it for the story?
   -Maybe? But the writing doesn't strike me near as good as the Witcher 3, or something like God of War or the Last of Us, granted the writing and dialogue is more perverted and explicit than those, but that doesn't make good writing
-Would I play it for the combat
   -Big no, when there's games like Doom Eternal, DMC5, and and CoD Modern Warfare out there, there's no need
-Would I play it for the driving/open world
  -GTA5
-Would I play it for the cyberpunk feel?
   -Now this I actually would, however, for 60 bucks, you can just get all the Deux Ex games and probably have a better time
-Would I play it for the decisions and character building?
   -Well considering there basically is none... no: Fallout 3 and New Vegas all the way

I do have some pro's with the game too but they are greatly outweighed by the negatives and are basically the same things everyone else is saying who likes the game. 

In summary this game is very underwhelming and undercooked and I highly recommend you wait for a sale (or at least for a bunch of patches). Me personally, I think I've had my fill and will go and play Terraria some more, because damn that game is a grade A masterpiece and I'm addicted to it. I do wanna say more about it but I feel this review is already too damn long so I will just leave it here, this is my first unironic review of a game so idk if I can directly respond to comments, but if I can I'll gladly go into more detail if anyone wants.

But it's like that episode of Ed, Edd, & Eddy, where they make that whole city out of cardboard and all it took to knock the illusion away was someone trying to climb the tower. Which is of course not possible in the game, despite the big ""verticality"" marketing they kept pushing. Everything starts glitching out the moment you start trying to explore the city beyond the surface level. This wouldn't even be an issue if the game wasn't filled with padding and filler content nonstop. The reason flying cars aren't in is because the game cannot stream the assets fast enough on the Lowest performing hardware, and the fact the buildings aren't actually there if you were to fly up there to look at them. It's nothing like Spiderman, more like GTA3. 

The combat feels like every generic looter shooter but worse. Animations have no impact, AI is non existent as a whole throughout the game, and the weapon options feel useless when compared to other categories. Getting augmented just boils down to opening a menu and slotting some stat changes into a slot, the only augments that change anything at all with your appearance or gameplay are the arms and legs. The arms are just a glorified weapon, while the legs are the only thing in the game that changes the gameplay somewhat. But both only offer 3 and 4 options to pick. Gorilla arms are useless because Body does everything Gorilla arms do. Skills like crafting are also useless and the looting system is what makes crafting useless. It's a watered down system like the rest of the game.

Regarding the world again, there is nothing to do outside of gigs, main quest, side quests and the 124124515 disturbances padded around the area nonchalantly. There is no in lore ""Gwent"" like game, no pool, darts, or even street racing beyond some missions for one character. I'll also bet there is no street racing or any minigames with another NPC, because there is no AI in the game that can properly run events like that. The thing this game needed most was more actual RP aspects instead of this half-done looter shooter with the RPG tag line on it. If this was a Rockstar developed game, every single interaction would've had it's own animation, instead of this menu slotting crap. I'm still laughing at the fact the gigs that involve carrying a body back to a car, always have you putting them inside the trunk, regardless if they are dead, alive, or even a hostage rescue. And your character just phases them into the trunk like magic instead of having an animation for even that. It's little things like that hurt the experience when they start adding up. 

I'm not gonna talk about the writing or story because I frankly just don't care about it. If someone else wants to review that then by all means go ahead. The only thing I'll say is I don't like Keanu Reeves trying to act all bad ass and crazy, because he is terrible at being that kind of character. He speaks like Butthead without the laugh when talking, and he is monotone throughout the entirety of the game. He's a great actor but I'll assume the casting director was too starstruck or didn't push him because he may have thought Hollywood actors are all some magic prodigies that know exactly how to play everything the first time. Who knows at this point. 

Now in a more positive light, CDPR has shown great passion in trying to fix the issues around bugs and performance. But that's a given and won't ever solve these blatant design flaws that hurt the game. AI might be fixed, but it won't fix the dead city or the gunplay, the augmentations being lackluster, or the fact the entire city is a cardboard cutout that falls over the minute you try to explore beyond the surface.

"Cyberpunk 2077 isn't just a broken mess. It is a manipulative, cynical, hypocritical broken mess.

I went into this game having seen virtually no marketing for the game, and none of the trailers. For the most part, I enjoyed the experience. It was an entertaining, if not fairly basic/unrefined action RPG. Like a decent Fallout (better than 3, worse than 4 and NV), but with some GTA elements. Again, it was fine and mostly enjoyable. 

The one major positive I can say is that its visual storytelling is on another level (*when it works*). The immersion of the first-person perspective along with really effective voice acting and mo-cap makes you really care about the characters you choose to invest time in. I wish more of the game had been this kind of interacting, it was easily the best part of the game. However, the romance options are incredibly limited, and boil down to basically a single in-game mission and maybe a small mention in the ending (if you picked the arbitrarily ""correct"" paths along the way). Unfortunately, the majority of the writing is pretty shallow and has little to say.

The game is still a bug-riddled mess, even on an up-to-date PC. NPCs walk through the environment, T-pose out of nowhere, or just disappear if they go off-screen for even a frame. The combat is.. fine. There's nothing special here, and every one of my friends who likes FPSs said the gunplay was absolute garbage. I figured that out pretty early on myself and went straight Intelligence/Hacking, which offered an interesting approach to the combat, but one that ended up being the same thing over and over and over again with no real variance. 

Then you look into what the game was advertised as, what it was supposed to be, and (maybe most importantly) *who* it was marketed to. CDPR was dishonest and misleading from the first look at Cyberpunk 2077. Go back and watch the 48-minute gameplay preview from 2018; it's an entirely different game. Clearly CDPR's intentions were much greater than their abilities, as most of the groundbreaking features seen in that preview are just not even hinted at in the final product. This is on top of the trans-phobic, dog whistle marketing campaign that surrounded this game (primarily on twitter). Despite the demands of factions of the internet gaming ""community"" that politics be left out of gaming (and the impossibility of this demand in the first place - art is politics, people), CDPR's marketing department took full advantage of what is basically a political culture war between conservative and progressive gamers. Blatantly including lgbt themes and imagery to stir up the right, while using said imagery in offensive and insensitive contexts to stir up the left; there is no such thing as bad press, after all.

Overall, CDPR made a broken, unfinished, cynical, dishonest, and incendiary product, while fully aware of its incomplete state and inability to run on current gen systems (PS4, XB1). Don't buy this game, don't support their anti-consumer practices, don't encourage their political muck-raking. Save your money and get a better RPG from a less greedy, cynical producer. Buy something from Obsidian or From Software.",False
"Its currently riddled with bugs and both looks and feels rather janky.

"[b]TL;DR version:[/b] ultimately heterogeneous (in terms of production quality) game that was nearly killed because of over-expectations from hyping fanboys. Solid 9/10 if you can avoid prejudice of overhype. Worth buying and playing (unless you have a really weak rig).

[b]Long version:[/b] My personal experience with this game differs from the general reception of this game, probably because of the lack of expectations. Didn't like The Witcher series, didn't really anticipated the CP2077 game and surely didn't praise CDPR like it's customary on the internet. And in the end neutral attitude towards the developer and the game itself allowed me to see the gem it is without feeling that I was scammed by someone.

[u]Story[/u] is really solid. It may be because of original source by Mike Pondsmith but CDPR managed to compile it all into a great 40 hour ride that my be not as perfect as RDR2, for example, but it's definitely better than 95% of the games that came out recently. Cutscene cinematography is breathtaking, mo-cap actors and animators did a really god job building the scene for story to shine on. Even side quests tend to have a thoroughly-written script masking the very basic gameplay of these quests. But then, disbalance shows itself: some of the side-quests as well as several main quests resort to notes as a mean of storytelling. It looks and feels cheap, not to mention UI that makes note reading a chore by itself. Main characters are well-written, deep and make you actually care about their part in the story.

One of the few things that seemed to be gimmicky at first was Keanu Reeves participation. At the first glance his only reason to take part in the game production was to bring more customers through heavy celebrity marketing but I was wrong. His role and his acting in this game is the cornerstone of it. He is not just the tool for writers to narrate things, he looks and sounds very real, he has something to say almost about any detail of the story and he truly becomes a part of protagonist and not the background actor. Later in the game developers actually use him as a second protagonist, and it feels very fresh and surreal to see yourself as the main protagonist, V, through the eyes of Johnny Silverhand.

Back to the story quality: the dialogues have basically no influence on the story. This is probably the reason why CDPR stopped marketing the game as ""true RPG"" close to release, because it simply isn't. That doesn't make the game any worse in my opinion, I believe that story that set on some ""rails"" is usually better than a dozen of varied storylines with zero depth. Lifepaths that we choose in the beginning also do almost nothing to how the story progresses.

[u]Gameplay[/u] seems to be disbalanced in terms of quality too. Netrunning and quickhacks, as well as stealth, do not bring unique experience to the table, you're still really dependant on weapons, so in the end you just ask yourself is it even worth to invest into stealth and hacking skills beyond some basic stuff if you're gonna still use guns most of the time. Locations also hurt stealth a lot since most of them are planned without the stealth in mind. It looks like level designers just threw in a few distractions here and there but didn't really think through how it's going to be played. Other games that heavily rely on stealth like Hitman treat level design a lot more serious, crafting the level around the player to create a big puzzle. CP2077 doesn't do that at all. Yes, it's an open-world experience after all, but it shows the lack of attention from the devs.

[u]Weaponry[/u] is pretty great in the beginning (although since we're in the game that treats itself like RPG, stats on the beginners guns are low at best) but after a couple of hours you start to notice that game arsenal is very limited and doesn't really bring versatility to the table. As far as my experience goes, melee weapons solve the enemy problem better, faster and more reliable than guns even without investing too much perk points in them. Expectedly, enemies in the beginning are annoyingly bulletspongey, later in the game they turn into absurdly weak cannon fodder that gets decapitated in dozens without actually hurting player even a bit.

[u]Vehicles[/u], well, are just okay-ish. It serves as a mean of transportation but nothing else. Driving is not enjoyable at all, vehicle diversity is non-existent, and best balanced cars are accessible very early without any downsides. Although, the level of details inside the vehicles really deserves an A+, designers really went an extra mile creating all the little details.

[u]Cyberware[/u] is a bit disappointing but decent. I was expecting to see something really rare and cool in the late game but cyberware choice (especially active one) is not that wide. Gets the job done, though.

[u]World[/u] around the player is uneven as well. Static world, it's design, is good. Some of the things in the level-design department may annoy you a bit because how obvious their purpose is (just to stall you and make you spend some time going through the maze instead of getting from A to B) but it does not lack detail at all. Every district has it's own soul and it doesn't disappoint. Dynamic world, on the other hand, is awful. I am talking about NPCs. [u]AI[/u] in this game is critically bad, and not a single time in the game when you can believe what's happening in the world around you if it's not hard-scripted by developers. NPCs are just bots with no personalities that always walk in circles or sit down and scream as soon as something dangerous happens nearby. Thankfully, game does not rely on NPCs in its gameplay, so player is mostly safe from this abomination of AI.

From the [u]techical side[/u], the game is weird mess. Despite being loaded from NVMe M.2 SSD you always see different LODs of models pop in and out. Vehicles and NPCs keep disappearing behind you, textures failing to load, FPS dropping without any reason, global lighting flickering. It didn't impact my gameplay too much but I believe people with mid-end hardware can suffer a lot of troubles even running the game, not to mention comfortably playing it. On the other hand, when nothing glitches or fails to load, game can show a really beautiful image. Characters are very detailed, textures are crispy even on the background stuff, lighting is gorgeous.

[u]Music[/u] is just beyond perfect. I have no idea how composers managed to create so much tracks that actually fit the narrative but I am excited to listen such great OST in the game. Every track complements the gameplay very well, especially when it comes to scripted events.

In conclusion, my thoughts on multiple release delays: maybe CDPR should've take another one or two delays to polish the game. There are moments in this game when you can clearly see cut content that was sacrificed to ship the game in time. Probably if developers took another path avoiding marketing forced hype and pushing deadlines, the game would be even better.",True
"---{Graphics}---
This game looks good. Like, REALLY good. Everything looks really polished and well designed. At least, when it's not bugged out.

---{Gameplay}---
The gameplay itself is where this game falls out I think. The gunplay sucks and doesn't feel satisfying with most weapons. Melee is crap. Driving is crap.

---{Audio}---
The only time I've ever said to people that I think the sound design is awesome. Probably one of the best parts of this game is the audio. Good soundtrack, design is realistic, etc.

---{Audience}---
For anyone that loves dystopian future scenes. If you like Deus Ex you'll love this.

---{PC Requirements}---
People meme that the game is impossible to run, that's simply not true. It's not easy to run at the higher settings, but I've had no issues on medium at 1080p with a gtx 1080, 16gb ram and an old i7 4790k. The CPU bottlenecks most things.

---{Difficulity}---
It's not very difficult. I'm playing on hard and I only die to enemies that are past my level.

---{Story}---
One of the most engaging and fun stories I've ever played in a game. It can be confusing at first if you're not aware of the setting.

---{Game Time}---
I feel like this game can almost go on forever with the amount of side quests and things to do.

---{Price}---
Worth the price.

---{Bugs}---
EXTREMELY buggy. One of the buggiest games I've ever played. From minor things like enemies floating around T posing, or AI not reacting, to the bigger issues like crashes. You will see a lot of issues until they get fixed. Too many for now.

---{Overall}---

"I don't hate this game bugs aside it's a solid 7.5/10 experience, but when you aren't doing the main story and instead are exploring the open world it doesn't feel like you are in a large cyberpunk city because there is simply nothing to do other than explore the area and do mission. I can't stress this enough because I feel like every game developer wants to make a huge open-world game. I can't help but feel like this game would have done better as a long linear based story that didn't skip most of V's early story.

"[h1]Summary[/h1]
The game has amazing graphics and a good story, but the immersion-breaking bugs, the subpar combat, and the repetitiveness outweigh the pros. Overall a 5.5/10, especially considering the number of years gone into developing this game, the budget, and the amount of marketing.
[strike]I will continue to play the game to give it a chance of changing my mind and if any patches fix some of the major problems.[/strike] I have decided to stop playing the game and come back to it when patched. Every time I got immersed in the story, I would run into bugs and dumb AI that took me out of the immersion. I don't it want to ruin my first playthrough experience. I recommend at least waiting for them to polish it. At the end of the day it's a single player game and you don't lose much by waiting.

[h1]The pros[/h1]
- Amazing graphics
- Decently optimized, especially if you have an Nvidia gpu and can enable DLSS. Highly suggest tweaking the ""crowd density"" option hidden under ""Gameplay"" (don't ask me...) if you're having issues in the city
- Good dialogue. Interesting conversations and I like the options presented when answering
- Good story. So far the story has been interesting
- Good atmosphere. It reminds me a lot of Deus Ex, but it's not as good unfortunately

[h1]The cons[/h1]
- [b]Bugs[/b]. A lot of them, especially if you're going open world and poking for them. Some examples include:
  + The ally NPC saying ""don't let them hear you, we need stay quiet"" in the middle of a gunfight
  + Turning around the corner in the middle of a gunfight and the enemy acting like they never saw you
  + Being able to escape the cops by just going straight
  + A confirm button being outside of the screen when using 32:9 ratio resolution, requiring a game restart
  + Occasional bugs with the Steam overlay
  + An NPC flipping horizontally for a second and then back up
  + The car not accelerating after a series of events

- The combat is not impressive. Very basic and it feels a little strange
- The game gets a little repetitive. I've only played it for a few hours though so I was on the fence on including this, but honestly if the beginning hours are repetitive, I can't imagine the rest. I'll change this if my opinion changes.

"First of all, I have to mention that I got to play the game on the launch date.
My experience might differ from others because I didn't stumble upon any game-breaking bugs (by game-breaking, bugs, I mean, bugs that stopped me from progressing in the game). But that doesn't mean there weren't any. I had immersion-breaking bugs, like people T-posing, cars flying into space, police spawning out of nowhere, lip-sync issues, and others.
Developers regularly deliver patches. And a-lot-of bugs the game had at the start have been fixed.
While I'm writing, this I am 90+ hrs in the game. I have completed all three life paths and a few side quests. Still have to unlock all the endings and do a lot of side stuff.  I've tried melee fighting, shooting, smart-shooting, and hacking.
Melee fighting feels clunky, but keep in mind that you are playing in first-person, and there aren't that many games where melee fighting feels smooth in the first-person perspective.
People were arguing that the shooting feels dull. But I enjoyed shooting even with smart-weaponry. Every shot felt impactful. There were occasions when shooting from long distance with pistols didn't register, but I'm not sure if that is supposed to be like that.
Police. I don't understand why they even added police. You can lose cops in a matter of seconds. Just drive straight for 10 to 20 seconds, and they lose you. It doesn't matter how wanted you are. And cops will spawn all around you. There have been times where I was in a closed room, and they spawned inside the walls. 
Skill-tree wasn't very well balanced. If you spend enough time looking through all the perks you can create an overpowered build with whom you could kill everyone with one shot.
All character customization options felt unnecessary because the only times you could see your character is in the inventory menu, mirrors, and when driving in a third-person perspective.
Most of the time, when choosing between, clothing you are going to pick the one with the highest armor rating, and you will end up looking like a goofball. So many types of clothing and you have to stick with the one who has the best armor. There are workarounds for this issue later when you get enough materials to upgrade stuff. But the more you upgrade items, the more expensive it becomes with every next upgrade. And you end up getting a new one. The best option is, instead of upgrading your armor every few levels, crafting a new set.
Cars. With all the customization options the game has I think it should have the option to upgrade or modify your car.
Even though there are a lot of bugs, I still enjoyed the game. The story was one of the best ones so far. The characters felt real and cool. Most games can't make that connection between you and fictional characters, but this wasn't the case. Not only does Cyberpunk 2077 have interesting characters, but it also has stunning visuals. After playing something else and coming back to Cyberpunk, graphics always seem to amaze me.
Stealth is pretty cool too. There are a lot of options for the approach you want to do while doing side quests. Hacking, stealth, or just go guns blazing. You always feel in control.",True
"It's really too bad this game launched the way it did.
It's also too bad it got hyped like crazy by Marketing and amped everyone up...

But you know what? Past that messy launch, past the empty shell of a city, the not so good A.I., and the bugs of varying severity (I must say tho that I've barely had any problems), this game is a gem.

Now here's the thing: the gameplay overall isn't really amazing or ground-breaking. It's generic for the most part.
However, it is saved by the sheer variety of play styles: you can sneak, blast, slash, shoot your way out of situations as you please. It's like playing many games (Doom, Mirror's Edge, CoD, Borderlands) at once.

What makes Cyberpunk 2077 a gem is it's writing, stories, characters and overall art direction (visual and audio).
Never have I ever felt as immersed playing a video game before. 
The experience was truly one of a kind.
There really is something to be said about playing a character exclusively in first person. I wasn't on board at first, but to be honest, it wouldn't have been the same otherwise.

The developers have thought of everything to make you part of the action.
Being able to read characters' emotions, to have meaningful interactions with people, actual relationships that develop over time, impactful storyline that has you so very engaged... No game, in my opinion, has ever reached that level. And it could've even pushed much further.

It's one of those types of medias you feel sad having to let go as the end nears, one that leaves you thinking for hours about the what ifs and the what abouts.

It really is too bad that the open world feels ""empty"" despite the sheer scale of the city and its surroundings. People in the streets feel hollow, barely registering your presence and that of other NPCs. Nothing really pulls you back to Night City.
I must say I am rather pessimistic about it ever being patched. Some things you just can't fix. But who knows.

For now, this game is worth playing exclusively for its story, main and secondary missions included. The gameplay is just extra.

"160 hrs in. I think I can write this now:

SHORT: The game is not without faults, but it is an amazing achievement

LONG: The world and lore that they created is amazing. Yes it is a little rough around the edges, and yes there are some bugs that will cause some aggravation, but overall my experience has been fantastic. 160 hrs in three weeks means that they did something right.

The true areas of genius are the open world, the side quests, and the graphics. There are so many different ways to approach the different challenges that there is some decent replay value. 

The challenges are the bugs, the lack of some open world staples from GTAV and others, and the disastrous previous-gen console release. The bugs I can understand. It happens with a game this ambitious and they are quickly patching the worst. The lack of some expected features I can live with because of the large expansions and patches they have already announced for the coming months. It is obvious they are devoted to fixing and expanding the game. 

The real failure was in the console release. Someone high up decided for the cash grab and released the game on the previous gen consoles, and that should have NEVER happened. The game looks and plays awful. There is no excuse for that. I understand why they did it, and I understand that it had already been delayed several times and their hand was forced a bit.....but it just should not have happened. Absent that, I believe 70% of the bad press would have evaporated. But here we are. 

All that aside, the game is a blast. It needs some balancing and rework of some of the perks. It needs some polish to the NPC spawn-in. It needs more depth to the characters and world. It needs the sync between the voice files and animations improved. It needs more content and lots more customization options for clothing, housing, and vehicles. And yet I put 160 hours into the game in three weeks. 

I recommend it. Play the game. Immerse yourself in the world. Do the side quests. Develop your character fully. Enjoy Night City and all that it has to offer. And above all wait and hope as CDPR continues to improve and develop the game.",True

"There is no way that one could deny that this game is good, however the feeling that you get from the game while playing it is lackluster. Perhaps it's due to the insane marketing CDPR did to promote this game that has been in development for the better half of a decade, but the game feels as though it just flops onto the ground. I can look past the bugs and glitches because that's not what kills the game for me. It is the seemingly lack of passion and the story feels as though it drags on and yet doesn't at the same time. I feel no urge to come back and keep playing, only the need to come back to finish the game - which is quite depressing to me. The mechanics are fine, the bugs are fine, the game is beautiful, but deep down the game doesn't feel good. Maybe everyone was expecting a game we still can't fathom, but even when I thought I had kept away from all the hype, I still feel let down. Is it worth 60 dollars, no, not to me at least. In a year when sales start coming and everything is fixed, maybe. Not now however... Not now.",False
"Cyberpunk Review 
Play Time: 104hrs

Story:
Characters - 7.5/10 (could've been fleshed out more)
Voice acting - 8/10 (great voice acting from main characters/some side characters, some random NPCs will sound weird at times)
Lore - 7/10 (fleshed out and nice to find out back story, but you need to read a lot or you'll miss out on some plots)
Plot - 9/10 good plot
Player impact - 6/10 (barely any freedom) passable
World - 7.5/10 (the world is amazing in terms of its visuals and exploration, but if you try to explore too much you will find the game is full of unfinished bugs/locations)

Gameplay:
Melee Weapons - 7/10 (fun but not balanced, way too strong)
Melee - 4/10 (everything about fist fights are terrible cause you will lose a lot)
Guns - 7/10 (fine, not anything revolutionary)
Stealth - 5/10 (useable, needs more work, not very good/fun to play)
Hacking - 6/10 (interesting enough for me to play with, but i wouldn't consider it fun if your using it for stealth)
Driving - 7/10 (passable, nothing revolutionary, could've done more)

Final Score
81/120 -> 6.7/10 ->7/10 without bugs | 6/10 with bugs [Don't buy this game until they fix the game, only then can i sort of recommend this game]
(The game is alright/good for the most part. But it's also very scummy move to change CyberPunk 2077 from an RPG to Action Adventure....)

How i rate games
0 - Literally unplayable | 1 - Barely playable | 2 - Horribly bad game | 3 - Really bad | 4 - Bad | 5 - Average | 6 - Above Average | 7 - Good | 8 - Great | 9 - Amazing | 10 - Godlike

Things i would want/change: 
More character development needed
[Characters with good character development] (Dependent on your choices)
- Johnny Silverhand (Can have good character development if you do the side missions, gigs, or go to specific locations throughout night city)
- Panam (Has a well fleshed out story with V, except if you choose the ending missions with her tribe it can get a little strange if you think of their decisions in a logical perspective)
- Judy (Good character development with V)
- River Ward (Good character development)
- Jackie (Sort of since our character development was through a timelapse of 6 months with him +5 missions)

[Characters that needed more character development]
- Rogue (Only got a few scenes with her through mostly flash backs, and 2 side missions with johnny)
- Vik (Don't know why Vik likes V since we have no clue about our back story with each other is)
- Misty (Jackie's GF and she has her character development while talking about jackie, but besides that 1 scene there isn't anything else)
- Mama Welles (Best friends with jackie but barely knows her even though she treats V like family)
- Evelyn Parker (Barely know much about her other than a few info tossed about her from time to time)
- Saul (Would've been interesting learning about them considering how important family is to the tribe)
-Mitch/Scorpio (Would've been interesting learning about them considering how important family is to the tribe)
- T-Bug (Barely in V's story apart from 4 or 5 scenes)
- Peralez Family (Could've gone on a bit longer since they're important figures in night city)
- All the Fixers (Literally none of them have any character development unless you look through and read about them on the Shards you pick up)

Needs more RPG aspects to the game even though CDPR changed the game from a RPG to an Action Adventure",True
pon pon pon,True
"Story is good, gameplay has a nice amount of variety available.

There are bugs but I am yet to encounter any major ones. So far I have had 1 crash to desktop with 22 hours.
There are less major issues like npc clipping and pop in but neither of these are particularly rare for large scale game environments.

Over all I have enjoyed my time with it thus far and have only encountered minor problems so I am happy to recommend it on PC.",True
"Rome wasn't built in a day. Neither was this masterpiece. Yes, there are a few bugs and performance issues. Yes, upon release Ryzen processors are only using physical cores and not threads. But, this game is amazing. So many things to do, so many ways to play. Everyone bitching about the game needs to give CDPR time to fix the game. There's a reason they kept pushing the release date back. It gives even the best hardware a workout, so of course there will need to be optimizations in upcoming patches. CDPR has showed no signs of abandoning this project, nor the playerbase. Patience, patience, patience.",True
"I follow a very strict, ""A game is worth it if I can get one hour of enjoyment per dollar spent on it.""

I completed the game once, was allowed to rollback before a point of no return in the story and continue playing, I was VERY satisfied with the ending I got and the content up to then (80 hours btw). I never felt blocked or impeded without it being a direct consequence of my own actions. I progressed a lot quicker than article writers would have you believe. Most importantly. I played with Medium Graphics on a ASUS with :

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8750H CPU @ 2.20GHz 2.21GHz
16.0 GB Ram

And I averaged at about 40fps (console levels) when doing anything but streaming via Discord or driving at 200 mph/kph (whatever speed the game uses) through the crowded parts of the city at which I would drop to 20fps, 10fps if doing both at the same time.

There are a lot of people saying the game is garbage, I say those people don't know how to be happy. After my time in the game though? I can say the game is very enjoyable and I will definitely come back in a month or so for another 80-120 hour playthrough more focused on the side missions (of which I did a lot of btw and when I finished there were still certain zones labeled very hard, so there was much more progression to be had, let alone the fact that I was level 30 and the max level is 50) once they have done some updates and fixed some bugs.

This is NOT because I think the game is too buggy, this is so I can accurately gauge the difference in gameplay between now and then.

I fully recommend and endorse this game because it is worth it and enjoyable. If you cannot get the game to start or play within the first 2 hours, refund it via the automated system. If you CAN get passed the 2 hour point and still find game breaking bugs (most I found were fixed upon saving and reloading btw) and still want to refund, make a legitimate ticket and appeal to Steam for a refund, rather than their bot which will auto deny.

TLDR : Game is good, give it a try. But be cautious if you're prone to saltiness over imperfection.",True

"101 hours playtime and 100% achievements. Loved the game world, and characters. Sadly the story feels kind of short broken down. nonetheless great game will play again 101/100",True
"The game is not what was shown off in trailers and official CDPR media. This game in it's current state feels like an alpha version, it feels incomplete. Explore enough and you will find the scattered remains of what could have been, items and environments clearly designed around features that were cut from the game. I wish I had listened to what had been said about the game, but I wanted to see it for myself, and lost the opportunity to have it refunded.
I really hope that Valve follows Sony and Microsoft and decides to extend refunds, we were lied to and deceived by a company that was widely perceived as trustworthy, and those like me who wanted to go in with an open mind are now being punished for it. Two hours of time in a game of this scale is not adequate enough to independently come to the conclusion that it is not the game that was promised, it was about 20 hours in that the bugs encountered through exploration and side-quests became glaring, and the novelty of the games beauty wore to reveal blatantly incomplete environments, npcs, and mechanics.

"I played over 100 hours of Fallout 76, one of the worst game releases in the past decade and even I have had enough of cyberpunk after only 30 hours.  I have greatly enjoyed the content I have been able to actually experience (excellent writing as to be expected from CDPR).  But the constant crashing and bugs is very demotivating.  I've had to constantly find work arounds in game to avoid consistant crashes and bugs (constantly rebooting the game, loading previous saves and avoiding a variety of content all together).  

One would expect with some of the terrible launches from triple A studios over the last few years that they would learn from these mistakes.   Unfortunately it seems even CDPR is incapable of releasing a functioning game these days.  Don't get me wrong, when it lets you play, the game looks, plays and feels great on a kick-ass PC but that doesn't exempt you from its many glaring issues.  But i guess we should just get used to half finished games from large game developer studios now as it appears to be becoming the norm.
  
I'd give this game an easy 8/10... when it works, it's an unpolished gem.  The real salt in the wound though is the manipulative PR claiming it would be released when it's ready, way to cultivate more distrust in game development studios CDPR.  Maybe after a year or so it'l be functioning, if they don't abandon it all together due to the mass refunds incoming.

Cannot recommend at this time, unless you have infinite patience and enjoy finding exploits to pass progress blocking bugs.",False
quit crying and get better computer,True
"I wanna get back into video making but I can't stand my voice, so this is the next best alternative. Before I get into saying my critiques, I want to make something completely clear. I had low expectations for this game, but that doesn't mean I thought this game was going to suck. People tend to forget that CDPR is no stranger to lying about their games. The Witcher 3 has downgraded in graphics but CDPR lied about it right to release. I expected something was off with the technical state of this game since the first reviews came out. Video Game Journalists are't a shinning tower of quality, however a stopped clock is right twice a day.

I am going to split the review into The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Not just because of the Dollar Trilogy but so I can split Core Design and technical state. I am in college for Game Development so I felt it fitting.

The Good:

I am still recommending this game so I mine as well talk about what I think is worth buying this game. If there is a 10/10 star system I would put Cyberpunk 2077 between 8-9/10 and that is rare.  So, why would I say that?

The game is satisfying, the story and characters of this game are top notch. It's been a while since I was able to play a game where I felt as powerful emotions then I did this game. Even the side missions are a great hint of fresh air, but I want to talk about game structure later. Writing wise, everybody did a great job in ever department which a few hiccups. I feel that the Lore shown in the descriptions for areas like the police forces wasn't matching up with gameplay, however they were in many cases matching up with the lore guides to Cyberpunk 2013 (the original), Cyberpunk 2020, and Cyberpunk Red's description. I should remind everybody that Cyberpunk started out as a table top game, and that themes were up to DMs and Players originally. Though, a game like this is the easiest way to do it.

Going onto gameplay systems and mission structure, the game has a few golden opportunities. the TLDR is it's a Ubisoft Open World but with less copy paste in it. The game isn't that predictable, as they don't go the cliche route of doing things. The driving is straight form Watchdogs (but the ground is made of ice), and the map looks like the ubisoft means too. I don't hate Ubisoft, if done right I think that style could and does work. The hacking mechanics are great, you can take people out with just hacks alone or use them make them not be able to see.

Finally, this game is stupid pretty. I looks amazing, and is every bit an upgrade compared to the trailers. Night city is just as much as what I imagined it to look like when I read through the rule books for 2013, 2020, and RED. Hell I own a par of dice from Cyberpunk RED cause I loved the world so much.

The Bad:

This part I want to talk about the Bugs. I have this part hear instead of Ugly because I feel like ugly should be reserved to core issues outside of things easily patched. Am I going to talk about all of them, hell know. I will talk about what I have gone through, usually I avoid bugs through shear luck. I played Fallout 76 and Hunt Down the Freeman barely managing to experience bugs. This game is not at though levels but I experience my far share a bad luck.

I went through walls, seen objects disappear, had vehicles constantly do a flip while driving up to me, enemies walk FAST AS FUCK BOIIII, NPCs de-spawn, cut scenes clipping into NPCs, hacks not go through, seen bullets go through walls but not cause damage, seen bullets go through walls and cause damage, Bosses able to grapple and snap the neck of, and enemies get stuck into walls. That is just what I could come up with right now.

Going to Performance, it is shit unless you turn down 1 setting. Even then, it doesn't work for everybody. Local Shadow Mesh Quality turn to Medium and everything else on Physio settings (including Ray Tracing) with the DLSS set to ultra performance. With a 2080 I was able to achieve a frame rate hovering to the 60s. I got strange choppy moments during the cut scenes but that was the majority of it. However I will be honest in saying that it happened during game-play however the reason is inconsistent. 

The Ugly:

TLDR: Gunplay is stiff but fine, driving is like driving on Ice, no customization of weapons and vehicles, outdated AI, and I really like to make these lists.

Starting with Gunplay, its serviceable. It is fun but it feels like the studio's first FPS game. But since this is the studio's first shooter game since The Orbital War that began in 2008. The guns feel unique but the obvious weapons of choice are always going to be pistols since they are OP.

Driving feels like it's from watchdogs, and I don't get why people complain about Watchdog's driving mechanics. Random cars on the street aren't going to have master class handling, but unlike watchdogs, Cyberpunk 2077's vehicles have no handling. You get used to it after a while but it is glaring in a world which feels like it has the same level of traffic as Chicago does on the highways. That's not a bad thing, it makes  the world lived in, but the actual driving mechanics should of been built around that in mind.

As said there is no customization, i mean you get what you get. There is a way to upgrade the stats of weapons but you have no control over the look of your guns and vehicles. You have no real way of making your character look the way you want too without scrapping the cloths you get and upgrade your current clothes. Better customization outfits would of been amazing, but instead, we have this.

The AI is straight outta the start of the Central African Conflict (2013). They are basic enough to work and nothing more. Civs are inconsistent and run away at random times. Cops angro after nudging them with the dodge system (which is quite realistic since they are american). Cars don't try to overtake your parked car, and sometimes stop in the middle of the road. It's a mess.

Conclusion:

With enough time I might start to grow against this game but there is enough going for it for me to personally love it. Though, the bad overtakes the good depending on who you talk too. This game was never going to live up to the hype, that's not the point though. Weather the game is good or not is up to the players to decide. Those are my two cents.

When you give CDPR its standard couple of years to fix this game it will be incredible I'm sure. For now I've been enjoying myself with minimal issue outside of occasion silly visual bugs. Make sure your rig can really run it if you plan to play any time soon.,True

"Just finished my first playthrough and I've got a lot to say, but few words to say it. 
First of all, the game is amazing. The part that stands out to me is the story, the writing. Incredible work on that front and I'm sure you won't be disappointed with the graphics, given your computer has the firepower to handle them. The gameplay is solid. Driving does the job, melee is decent, hacking is satisfactory and shooting feels incredible. The progression system is in-depth, and you can spec out your V the way you want to, and how you want to. It is very versatile.
The parts of the game we saw in the ads were the more action-packed parts of the story, but, although those are incredible, I also enjoyed the slower parts a lot. To me personally, they were the best thing this game had to offer, but I think it's something you have to experience for yourself to make a good judgment on it.
The characters are well developed, and I'm sure CDPR will add more content to further the romances already available, and give us some more to experience. The voice acting was really good, too.
From a technical standpoint, the game is a bit of a mess. I'm talking about bugs here. Even though I didn't encounter many, some of them were a bit immersion breaking, which is disappointing. Some features also need a little polishing and work put into them.
Overall, really happy with the experience, and I'll be diving right in again for another playthrough. 
This game is fucking awesome.",True
"Cyberpunk is great, it is like open-world Deus Ex which is about what I expected. Very immersive. The only major issue are occasional bugs which takes you out of the immersion, does not break the game, but reminds you that this is a videogame. Also the crowd AI is bad, even for open world standards. Other than that, its a great game, definitely not mind blowing. As long as you kept your expectations in check, you won't be disappointed.",True
"Game is fine needs some fixes here and there but so far is fine , of course it misses a lot of features saw in trailers which is a shame if u ask me but it does show how complex it is i mean if u really like cyberpunk get it , won't be disappointed :D",True
"Alright, I was bottlenecked to Low by my CPU.

It's buggy. I didn't experience something particularly gamebreaking. Immersion breaking on occassion, and reloading was necessary to fix some UI bugs. 

First Playthrough as a Stealth-Heavy Hacking guy on Normal. Took me about 37 hours, with a lot of both Major (from Main Missions) Side Quests and some pure side quests. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. 

Overall, it's great if you can run it and don't get screwed by the bugs. Here's hoping to it getting patched.",True

Not the best open-world RPG in there, but it's get job done. Open world full of side quests wherever you go, you will get something to do.

Would recommend to at least try it. In a couple months from now on. Let the release hype to settle in and give CD Projekt RED some time to fix bugs and increase overall performance.
",True
"Yes, the game has bugs. I flew out of my bike once. Some buttons don't seem to register flawlessly. Talking animations might be delayed.
Yes, these take away from the game experience.

All good? Are we done with recognizing that the game is buggier than we expected? Ok cool. Because bugs are  temporary but the game's core is permanent and let me tell you friends, that core is BREATHTAKING.

The world design is perfect. The ugly concrete masses of buildings at day turn into neon temples at night. We have the technology to do so much more, even fix and improve our body's shortcomings. But people are miserable and living in this world would be terrible.
High Tech, Low Life. The way Cyberpunk is meant to be.

The characters, the story (so far), the sounds, the whole immersive part is just flawless. Not to mention KEANU. Srsly though, he has a meaningful part in it. And he HAS a part in it. He doesn't just appear in a couple of scenes.

The gameplay is also top of its class. You can build your character in a number of way through not only skills and perks (which you gain by leveling AND improve by doing things); but also through different items and cybernetics. This allows you flexibility to be a specialist, to be a jack of all trades, to be whatever. And that's good, because the game allows you to fix 90% of things your way. And for that 10% you have ways to make your life easier through your focus.

For example, you may be able to use hacking to overcome so many obstacles. You may stealth a whole mission. Or maybe you use a mixture of them.
Too much? You can also shoot your way through!
And it's not just that. The way the story plays out depending on your choices. One player may face a main-story scene and handle it with stealth. The other player might face it in a way that the enemies are different. The other may be shooting everyone. Surely there are some points everyone witnesses, but believe you me, CDPR manages to deliver so well in those ones that it doesn't matter.

On top of all, you have a free-play option. There is something happening in Night City all the time and you'll never run out of things to do.is a legendary game that deserves a spot near modern-day classics such as Bloodlines (which had WAY worse bugs at launch btw), Witcher 3 and Fallout New Vegas.

Update after 160+ hours, completing the game on two characters:
Bugs are stil not a big enough issue. I realized there are more choices than I thought but also less than I thought. I tried completely different built characters and the experience changes...

..except difficulty. The game becomes too easy too fast unfortunately and this decreases the value of the experience and different builds to a point. But that's not felt that much unless you are doing a full run on every character.

Overall, I still recommend the game (it's up to you to risk bugs you face, I personally didn't see anything more than I saw in games of similar size). I think the game could have been much better, but that's not a move from (score-wise) 50->70, more like from 80->110.
CDPR may not have delivered on the semi-vague promises but it's a solid game for sure. And I'm sure we'll see a lot of changes and improvements over the year.",True
"Really good game, scale of NC is amazing and story flows well.

Only downfall is the AI or lack thereof",True
"So after beating the main story and going through every alternative ending I can give a half decent opinion.

The game is good, it's not great. (I won't even be going into the insane amount of glitches or performance issues)

The main story was very good, did lack a bit of depth and some of the writing could have been better, but nevertheless i really enjoyed the main story line and some of the side ones. 

The environment looks really good but its mostly an empty shell. You can't really interact with anything outside of missions. The only thing you can do is kill random gang members once in a while and thats as far as open world goes.

There is no AI for vehicles or civilians, they are just assets with a line path that they follow, they have absolutely no interaction or reaction to events around them except for crouching in random places.


Fun for the main story, a few good side quests, the rest is pretty bad.",False
"I really want to love this game, but it isn't complete and the devs clearly cut corners and cut content to get it out the door.

- Night City feels like Hong Kong from Sleeping Dogs, but without driving AI.

- Cops literally spawn in beside you when you commit a crime. 

- The combat is plain

- The side missions lack any depth

- There's a""One Year Later..."" Cutscene that features tons of animations you'd recognise from trailers, it feels disingenuous

- (Visual) Glitches are plentiful

- Barebones ""RPG"" elements, barely any player choice

To me, the last item is the worst one. A case study is the 'fixers' who are mission givers in this world. They'll give you jobs as you roam Night City and walk near one of the events. You receive a phone call, sometimes just a text message with mission details. You complete the mission, hear a few lines, and get paid. There's a lack of connection with the characters, less conversation choices (if any). You figure out things about the world through data pads instead of conversations. There isn't any depth! 

The Witcher 3 had us bringing people back into an area, hearing peoples pleas and worries and trying to help them out, I felt far more engaged with what felt like a breathing world.

By comparison, 2077 has no character, no traditional RPG elements, and I feel ripped off.

"Cyberpunk 2077 has largely delivered what I expected. I played 4 hours straight at release and another 8 after a little break. Both times I lost complete track of time and barely noticed how long I had been playing because the game is just that immersive.

I've experienced rather few bugs, if anything the physics were going wild for me during times (especially when it comes to cars and people in cars accidentally driving over people not in cars).

On a 1080 Ti OC and a 8700k OC (SSD + enough RAM) the game runs on max settings with stable fps in 1080p. If you choose to turn down some heavy settings like Cascaded Shadows Resolution etc you can most likely get the game to an enjoyable state with less hardware.

Overall very happy and looking forward to future updates and content.",True

"To get the bad out of the way first: yes, it's buggy. Nothing game breaking, but many texture glitches and the like. Any major graphics issues and crashes are likely the result of an out-of-date video driver, so update that before playing. I’m running with a 2070S, and it runs flawlessly at 60+fps on ultra (no RT).

However, it is not to say that this feels unfinished. Due to the depth of the plethora of mechanics and playstyles it offers, I honestly forget what genre of game I’m playing very frequently. Given the sheer scale of the game Cyberpunk is, a few minor glitches are no surprise, and I’m sure they’ll all be fixed in due course. I had never been exposed to the Cyberpunk world until I started following this game, and even my admittedly few expectations were blown completely out of the water. Here is a game that offers the most freedom of any I’ve encountered, in a world that feels more real than anything I’ve experienced. And I’m sure my recommendation will only grow as time passes, I experience more of the game, and CDPR’s plans for DLC/expansions come to light.",True

"I don't even know if it's worth writing something here. the game is really great, the graphics are amazing. technically performed at a masterpiece level, plus the setting complements the visual.

I haven't finished the game yet (it's clear from my 14 hours). but for a long time I have not been so drawn into the plot. and it's just nice to drive around the city, because it is so well designed. side quests are not boring to complete, they, of course, do not reach the level of the main ones, but they should not.

I think, and so everyone understands that the game is cool. but the cons, too, can be said. yes, there were a couple of bugs with npc without animation (you know, when standing with arms out to the sides). Yes, I saw two identical npc opposite each other. in principle, that's all. in such a game there can be no bugs, it is a huge open world. they will be fixed very soon anyway.

I hope they will also work with optimization. I have no problems with running the game on ultra presets and ultra rtx. the only thing is that after a couple of hours of play, the average FPS drops by 15-20 frames. after restarting everything comes back.",True

"I got Cyberpunk off of Stimulus money so as far as I’m concerned, the government paid for this game which does negate some of the problems I’d normally have for dropping 80$ or so on a preorder. Use that information how you will.

Let’s do a quick dive into the story, and there may be some spoilers here but it’s mostly for Act 1, which is reachable just a couple hours depending on how quickly you want to unlock the whole city (as you’re locked to one region until you complete a major heist). 

You play as V, of any variety of gender identity you wish (though you are stuck with he or she pronouns). Basically a futuristic mercenary that does any kind of work available, kind of giving me some vibes from Burn Notice. Arms deals, stealing fans, VIP extraction, and so on. Of course, nothing goes as plan and you more or less lose your entire initial team after a heist goes wrong in every way possible. You’re witness to a world changing shift in a power structure and are forced to insert a chip with the ‘soul’ of Johnny Silverhand, an angry and incredibly bitter man who staged a bombing decades before V enters the game. This becomes the driving force of the game as you work to remove him safely from your body before he replaces you entirely - Something that not even he can stop, really.

I’ve only had my toes dipped in Cyberpunk as a genre but it seems pretty standard fare. The concepts of “do cybernetics eat your soul’ and the various debate of how much human makes a human, all that. You’re put right there in center force as you grapple with these questions, even though our avatar as V is more concerned with just curing themselves like it was any other terminal disease. Even in-universe, the idea of a soul-preserving microchip is still a relatively new invention, though still in development enough to be advertised and talked about in news circuits.

So let’s approach my first problem. It takes several hours for the game to essentially ‘wake up’. For a long time, you’re stuck in several conversations and interactable cutscenes with very little gameplay except taking advantage of V’s chosen origin in dialog. A couple of firefights here and there but the initial region locks you in and there’s only so many world encounters to just run into. The game more or less railroads you into completing Act 1 with some haste, because it also unlocks the ability to get more cybernetics and even some actual, full on mechanics. Within that railroading, you’re witness to so. Much. God. Damn. Talking. Mercifully you can press or hold “c” to skip through some things if you already understand the gist, but the first several hours of the game can very much feel like a very pretty walking simulator.

Thankfully this kind of goes away after Act 1. You suddenly get called by a variety of Fixers that preside over various regions and they toss you dozens of side-jobs to do and so far, I find them to be delightfully varied. As a stealther, I found great joy in having a VIP escort quest with the optional objective of not sounding any alarms. So I went and bought myself a silencer and happily snuck around some gang mates boxing in the middle of a building, retrieved my guy, and escorted him outside while leaving several enemies alive. It was a great achievement. These side-gigs can be as complicated or straightforward as you please, giving me some Dues Ex vibes. The tutorial introduces you to hacking so you can distract and destroy your enemies how you see fit, and I have found that most encounters are designed with alternate routes to deal with enemies.

Others are less clear. During one gig, I opened a door and the entire bar went ape on me, so I shot my way through and earned two stars from the police. Turned into a massive shootout that led to a dropbox that had gang members in it that also shot at me. Playing on Easy is a saving grace, but as someone who typically likes sneaking around games when the option is available, I wish the game made it more clear if I'm in a ""suspicious"" type zone. I also have no idea which NPC's are counted as potential enemies (the scan early in the story tells you if they're in a gang or not), as perfectly normal NPC's in the aforementioned bar just began unloading on me. It was wild, and I survived and got paid but the mission giver telling me it was sloppy work. Thanks, lady. Another time I opened a gate and trained my silenced pistol on the guard only for her to slightly sidestep as the gate opening “alerted” her. So I missed the shot, she opened fire, and the entire structure came out to play. It was an intense gunfight in which I was victorious, but it felt hollow as my silenced approach just botched the entire encounter.

It was difficult for me to figure out what the game’s general “loop” is. So far it gives me the Ubisoft vibe of “hit everything you run into”. I do like the idea of V being something of a vigilante, as random police encounters pretty much allow you to intervene and gun down gang members without them bothering you about it. I must admit, however, I wish there was more to actually DO in the game. So far it’s mostly just side-gig after side-gig. Escort guy here, steal a van there, eliminate all enemies here. Though again, I said before that some of this can be quite enjoyable under the right circumstances. Maddening in others. In a way, this is kind of the Rage 2 problem all over again, in the sense that people loved the general gunplay but there wasn’t actually a lot of gameplay beyond the decent combat mechanics. Cyberpunk 2077 is certainly no GTA5, but I hope some day it can become that with DLC’s that add actual activities.

A couple of quick asides. I despise the driving, as most vehicles seem to want to spin out very easily if you hold the turning key for a second too long. In some fashion, it forces you to drive like an actual sane person and mowing down civilians (even accidentally) adds a GTA-esque wanted level though it seems stupidly easy to avoid. Narratively, it makes sense as the authorities in this universe are incredibly corrupt and it basically amounts to “eh, they’re too far now, let’s not waste resources”. So, fair enough.

Still, I hope to GOD there’s no mandatory story-based racing. Games have screwed me on that before, and I have not beaten most GTA games because of that.

Secondly, I don’t think the origin choice does a lot. You get different dialog choices and being a Corpo did lead to one interesting turn when you just ‘knew’ a credit chip had a virus on it. So there is that, but ultimately the rest of the dialog is identical. You could chalk this up to V spending six months with Jackie and he, more or less, lets your V really swim in Night City culture but honestly ALL V choices feel like they’ve become the same person. I was originally a Corpo but it just feels like her past and culture didn’t seep in through most of the dialog. At the end of the day, V is always just some mercenary punk.

The world is gorgeous, albeit not as alive as it may have been advertised in promotions. Random civilians just have canned dialog, a lot of it rude. However I’ve been hard pressed to find doubles or clones of anyone just walking around, but that may change once I get into the hundreds of hour counts. It’s a very pretty game and despite some of my qualms, I am enjoying the experience. There’s a photo mode which is wonderful to utilize when you run into an environment that just captures the imagination. I took a screenshot of Jackie’s wall of pinups, including a typical slutty nun but as per the universe, her chest filled with beautifully placed cybernetics. It was just fun to see, and there’s a lot of semi-subtle world building like that that I just adore.

The game has issues. However, if you wanted a slightly scaled back idea of GTA5 with a different aesthetic, this is not at all a bad choice. However I will not blame anyone if they wait for the “GOTY” editions to come out.",True

"I've finished the game and it's difficulty to give a good review in the current state of the product. 
No doubt that game have awesome story line and side quests, but technical issues destroying all immersive feeling.


- Glitched game physics
- Floating Cars, npcs or t-poses,
- Lack ammount of various looking civilians, 5 or 10 same clones spawning or perhaps it is a bug either
- Broken Wanted police system
- Bugged interface menu
- Chaotic Driving mechanic on keyboard ( but u can fix it with mod from Nexus Website )
- Spawning or Disappearing cars/npc on the front of your face.
- Wearing clothes is bugged either, mirror showing you that you are completely naked or bald if you wearing a cap.
- Very bad optimization 
- When you drive as passenger in the vehicle, the experience is awful, npc's driving mechanics looks like a alpha or beta version, they teleporting or they doing unrealistic and plastic movements and also they don't even moving a steering wheel.
- Cars or npcs crossing the buildings/objects like a ghosts and its happening quite often
- Unbalandced mechanic of the game, the implants that you installing are not improving your gameplay at any way, it looks just all about crafting the armor and weapon.

What a shame.

The game itself is very good but he is suffering from technical issues. Not sure if they gonna fix it all, because the ammount of bugs are massive. I will give thumbs up as soon they gonna fix at least most of it.

"As a long-time PC gamer and reader of sci-fi fiction, I've enjoyed playing this game.   Yes there are imperfections but the developers successfully blended loot and gun mechanics from Borderlands, with the open world of grand theft auto, and with the very satisfying RPG design from the Witcher 3.   The flat spots that I've seen people mention the most are topical elements/flaws that could be refined over time.    For me, the game satisfies a long overdue blade runner-esque game itch that I hope will influence other developers to explore this territory further.   

Two strategic choices that I wish CD Project Red had taken a different direction on:
1. They released all versions (pc, ps, etc.) at the same time -- the need for a working game across all platforms right from release may have put additional strain and pressure on the devs. to make tradeoffs with game design (much like Skyrim's UI) that negatively impact PC users.   But from a revenue perspective, can we really blame them?  And they can probably use the console revenue to make the game better over time...at least that's my hope.

2. Better love, relationship and yes, sexual elements.  In the Witcher 3, I'm presented with relationships from the opening tutorial and then all the way through the game.  This kept me deeply invested in all the characters throughout my experience.  In Cyberpunk, the relationship element feels disjointed, heavily revised, and less bold in general.   I'm not sure if this is the result of making the game more palatable to mainstream gamers, or for some other reason.  But the good sci-fi cyberpunk stories (from the likes of William Gibson, Philip K. Dick, etc.) pose interesting questions about how humans will interact, relate and love one another when the lines between human and technology become so incredibly blurred. 

All that said, I am enjoying the game and immersed in exploring this new world CD Project Red has created for all of us.

"(This is a review from a PC gamer's perspective.)

Even though I have a NICE amount of hours on this game so far *giggity*, I'm only in the beginning of the game and a very strong opinion to claim that I highly recommend this game.
I've had only 1 crash on the day it came out and a few silly bugs (99% of them just visual).

If you're the type of gamer that gets upset by that 1% of bugs that restarting the game will fix it, I'd say not only don't get this game but don't get any big game, because these type of bugs can happen. Computers aren't flawless and neither the humans who make the games.

If you liked The Witcher 3 gameplay and you like FPS games, this is exactly what the game is, plus you have many ways of dealing with your enemies. And just like The Witcher 3, the beginning was also with bugs but CD Projekt Red fixed them and I'm pretty sure these will also get fixed.

One of the issues I've been getting is using a non-lethal weapon but my enemies still die. Is it problematic? Not really. Do I think CDPR will fix this minor thing? Definitely!

Regarding the story, since I'm still in the beginning, it is compelling... I've laughed, I got mad at characters, I got sad for them, I've cried. Same goes for the side stories, they bring your emotions.

There's also easter eggs and references, even on the shards that you read.

"This is a shallow game with not even the quarter of what was promised throughout the development process. AI is a joke. It's like from early 2000s games. City is dead. Even the city from the ancient game Omikron: Nomad Soul was more alive. No interactions in the city apart from the predesignated quest related spots. They managed to create a hollow playground even tho there are tons of zombie NPCs (mostly copies of each other) and the beauty of blinding neon lights.

Side quests are slightly flavored with voice and text but they are subpar compared to the good rpg games from the last decade. 

Story is nice, main story feels good so far (as far as i progressed at least). Story can be rushed and enjoyed if anything.

Gunplay is enjoyable but stealth and hacking mechanics are very low quality. It's amazing how devs didn't even bother checking the quality in comparison with the DX:HR.

Unless they make a revolutionarily good revamp of the game, don't waste money and don't support such hypocrite marketing.

A lot of people overhyped the game and expected it to be some godly ascendant but if you stop holding games at such a high regard 24/7 you won't be so disappointed. I got exactly what I expected out of Cyberpunk and am happy with it! 

Controls are great- I found that it's a little bit of a learning curve to get used to their take on technological aspects and various other mechanics but there was fun in learning all that stuff :)

"CDProjektRed Lied and covered things up regarding performance issues on console and general bugginess of the game. The review bombing, refunds and backlash as a result of some horrible PR decisions that Red made.

I'm thinking if CDR, instead of covering things up, made a giant poll to get public opinions as follows:

The game has a bunch of bugs and performance issues left to stamp out before release, would you all be fine with a release right now, knowing it's basically Early Access? You submit feedback and bug reports and we will rigorously patch it as fast as we can.

People might overwhelmingly say yes, then we play it and submit bugs and they patch it. You'll have complaining but it won't be the giant dumpster fire that it is right now.

CDR made poor decisions regarding Public Relations. It's almost like they never made a video game before it's weird. Between 2020 being a crappy year and the general gamer anger when it comes to hyped games being released with bugs.

It 'is' buggy. It has optimization issues on PC too but it's no where near as bad as the consoles.

- Optimization issues.
- A plethora of immersion breaking bugs such as NPC pathfinding, clipping through objects, wonky physics. (In one of my missions where someone had to drive me, he just crashed into and kept going a car I had parked in the area lol then kept talking like nothing happened.)
- Audio issues like traffic noises would suddenly get excessively loud in areas without a lot of cars around. Music abruptly cutting out, crackling sound sometimes, sound effects cutting out sooner than they should.
- I've seen a tree just... reconstruct itself it was awkward. I have it recorded lmao.
- Traffic in the streets have issues in crowded intersections. No one following traffic lights so they'll get jammed and not move.
- Combat itself needs balances across the board. I have a gun that one shots everything in the head and automatically aims for me too. Very hard difficulty... MELEE build. I have no perk points in guns and this gun is still one shotting everything. The game is generally way too easy if you have even 10% of a brain building your character. But Witcher 3 was easy too even on the hardest difficulty and I know CDR cares mostly about story telling over challenging gameplay. But there really are some definite balancing issues regarding combat.
- I've been in combat with NPCs who just fell face first onto the ground while running... I've also taken fall damage going down stairs it's weird. I'll be going down stairs and suddenly just fall onto the ground, get stunned and take damage lol.

I'm sorry I know that the game reviews aren't a bug report so I'm going to stop. I seriously have so much more and I've game clipped all of them happening. Despite all of this, I'm having fun with the game. I really enjoy it and have put in 90+ hours already. The problem is people see a hyped game receiving hate and the bandwagoning begins. Coupled with the terrible public relations decisions made by CDR, you have what you see here.

You will likely enjoy the game if you buy it now as long as your expectations are set correctly and understand where the hate is coming from. I also know CDR isn't going to leave the game the disaster it is right now. They ARE going to patch it and fix everything up guys, then release a plethora of free DLC like they did with Witcher 3 and some other new content.

Just have some patience and the game will be flawless and amazing before you know it. If I'm having fun right now on a game this unpolished, it's going to be awesome when it's fixed.",True

"It's a very pretty game, but like the food you take out of the microwave too soon, it's still cold in the middle. I'm hoping they finish this game after release because the pieces are there to make something great. Recommend waiting to see what CDPR does in the coming months.",False
"My friends please wait before you buy this game

Quick edit: Audio popping and crackling is fixed from lowering the sample Quality. The game doesn't like anything around 96khz, lowered it to 44k and no pops or crackles. Yes I have the newest drivers, I've never had a crash only instable fps. If you have crashing issues make sure you have it installed.

One big grife or complaint I had since I opened the game is there feels to be a lack of customization, hair cuts are locked behind the chosen gender, but you can change the voice to any sex, and change the genitalia, so why cant I just have some of the haircuts the dudes have or visa versa? There is no colour sliders, colour pickers, length options, adjusting any of the features only a selection presets. Preset colours,preset features. Hair has something like 20-30+ noses 14+? 

this game is rich in density and absolutely beautiful, but holy hell is it ruined when a car slides in from a building infront of me. The way npcs and things spawn in is really odd to me. the story so fine is interesting, characters are interesting or well designed, cant say much about the story so far but the game kinda makes me feel like Door Dash. I'm enjoying the character acting so far but not so much with the main character they kinda sound awkward like Male Shep from ME2.

Through the environment I've experienced constant bugs, animations failing to load, things not rendering properly. A 3000 series rtx isn't going to make this game better. I have a RTX 3080 OC vision.  Visually yeah the game looks amazing but it runs terrible. To test it out, I cranked every setting to high, Ray tracing to psycho, and space screen reflections on psycho 1440p. I was averaging 52-65fps, reducing ray tracing, DLSS helps performance, putting everything down to med/high (shadows med, reflections etc) gets around 80-90fps. The default presets are a poor difference between settings as low and med are hardly different, cranking down reflections and shadows helps with performance but not stability. have a few RTX settings on dont seem to impact as much as having RTX off and DLSS off for performance. Playing this game on 1080 is well over 120fps but for some reasons the models don't seem to be textured nicely and well 1080 feels extremely blurry to me.

 This game is crashing frames and chugging in cutscenes when even rendering in vehicles for a chase. NPC's randomly reset animations and idle then snap back into their intended animation loop. The NPCs AI in RDR2 are far superior, have a reaction or flee to the initial danger and then returning to the original positions of course then thats tieing more onto cpu performance but I honestly wouldn't mind. Instead you have the NPCs locked in their reaction animations, and new ones spawning into the area walking past while the others stay couched in fear. Some small physics issues as well. I got pushed across the room because ""your"" partner in game walked into me putting me in front of the enemies and blowing my cover.  Certain steps or other objects on the floor collide somewhat weird. Stealth cover feels like an afterthought with mediocre cover

 I'm still messing with the settings to find the optimal performance and quality.  Wait to buy this game , this is so apparent within the first 20-30 mins that its filled with tons of bugs and has terrible optimization issues. This game needed at least another few months to fix all the weird animation issues. This is not something that one could say "" just have a super powerful rig it runs fine!"" because it doesn't regardless of cards its an engine issue. But it still runs like shit on my partners 1080ti behind me what a joke lol also god help you if you don't have anything higher than a 2080 card.

"Massively stripped back 'RPG' that has more in common with GTA, than any of the imagination or creativity that went into creating the Witcher 3. An incredible world to explore and gawk at, but one that is held back from greatness by dated AI, mediocre combat and poor driving. Currently the only thing keeping me going is navigating the awe-inspiring environments and listening to the stellar soundtrack. There has been the occasional nifty side quest, but the majority have been let down by the frankly piss poor writing, edgy one-liners and all. The cherry on the shit stained cake is easily Keanu Reeves' sloppy inclusion, his voice acting is so stilted and lifeless that everytime he's on screen I roll my eyes. His casting was clearly just a marketing gimmick and displays a disturbing trend in modern gaming to appeal to casual or 'normie' players who can't comprehend interesting mechanics, let alone have the concentration required to appreciate a well-crafted, thoughtful game. Easily one of the most disappointing games in recent memory and a truly dull experience for anyone looking for any semblance of a deep RPG. Ah well, least it's nice to look at? That is when the game performs well. I haven't encountered many bugs but the choppy framerate even at 1080p on my GTX 1660 super is pretty laughable, God help anyone playing this on consoles.

Well done CD Projekt Red, you've successfully become as lousy and out of touch as Bethesda are.

2. Characters 
--> the real strength of the game, the main cast for major and side quests as well as romance is simply fantastic
--> well written and artistically designed
--> great voice acting
--> you'll wish to return to them similar to games like Mass Effect or The Witcher

3. Gameplay
--> quite a few ways to solve combat sections
--> meelee, stealth, different ways to play with guns, hack skills as a substiute for a mage of fantasy settings
--> the minus here is that you can become overpowered quickly if you do all side content, on normal difficulty you will have no problems
--> dumb AI
--> I played with mantis blades and even though it became easy with the right skills it still was super fun to go through a lot of enemies
--> don't ignore the Cold Blood skill tree IT'S AMAZINGLY FUN if you like power fantasy in combat

4. Graphics & Glitches
--> looks amazing with RTX effects, but very demanding
--> you have to fiddle around to get the right settings for your PC
--> standard settings are not super helpful
--> you should currently quicksave a lot to avoid bug issues, also stealth gameplay kinda requires quick saving anyways
--> there are quite a lot of graphical glitches, but mostly nothing game breaking

"Now that the hype has died down and I've had time to think about Cyberpunk I can't honestly recommend this game to anyone right now. Not in its current state, not for its current price. There are so many things holding this game back that even if we stripped away all the bugs, I still don't think the game that would be left would be very special. Considering how few and far between the actual critical decisions in this game are, it just feels like a much buggier, much less enjoyable Ubisoft game with a ridiculous amount of fluff padding to make the game seem more interesting than it really is. 

Below is my original ""review"", which should be taken as first impressions. This was before I realised how boxed in you are with your decision making. 

So far, a fantastic game. It definitely needs a few optimisation passes to make it run a bit better, but for the most part this game is pretty incredible. 
Highly recommend you run this game off of an SSD to minimise bugs related to animations and sounds not playing, level and texture streaming, etc etc.",False

Yes, the PC version of Cyberpunk 2077 is not without it's own share of bugs/issues, but worry not my pedigreed chooms. The lost and confused yet humbly conscientious folks over at CD Projekt Red are burning the midnight oil to get these issues resolved faster than a corpo would stab his own mother in the back if it meant a 0.00001% increased chance at a promotion to middle management.

The neon sprawl known as Night City provides a richly immersive setting for you to get lost in. There's no shortage of eurodollars to make, protocols to breach, and burritos to eat when it comes to the exploring this metallic playground, but where this game really shines is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the main story. Anyone who's played the Witcher games knows that the folks over there in Warsaw know a thing or two about how to pen a compelling story, and while I haven't completed the game yet, I have gotten far enough to be fascinated with what has occurred so far.

Visually speaking, the game does an admirable job at staying true to the intended aesthetics for cyberpunk as a sub-genre. Technology is legion in the streets of NC and no part of man's physical body is off-limits when the corpos want to sell you a superior, military-grade, cybernetic replacement. The abandonment of flesh in favor of steel is not without its cost, and as man becomes more and more machine, he finds himself struggling to keep his morality intact. This is the gritty reality of life in Night City, such as it is, and Cyberpunk 2077's visual representation showcases this well. It isn't quite as miserable as you might imagine, but I'm fine with that because I don't need too much miserable reality in my escapism. Also, as the name implies, this game was meant to be played when the sun has gone down (in game I mean). Playing during the daytime, to me at least, just felt off. Put it this way: Imagine going to a Marilyn Manson concert at 9am in the morning, outdoors on a beautiful cloudless day. It just doesn't produce the full effect, probably because sweet dreams are made at night.

Now let's talk about audio. It seems a lot of folks out there were none to thrilled about the absence of any synthwave/outrun inspired pieces in the game's soundtrack. Pish posh and a pox upon them, says I. Cyberpunk 2077's OST compliments the game's visuals and atmosphere brilliantly. Licensed tracks aside, the game's musical score is primarily made up of (unsurprisingly) electronic music, but there's a certain industrial/glitch sound thrown in as well. The pulsing, distorted rhythms that accompany the game's many opportunities for violence invigorates the spirit and bloodies the blade and if my katana could smile, it would grin. The music reminded me of classic electronic artists such as Prodigy, Leftfield, and the Future Sound of London as well as genre-defining albums like the Hackers and Matrix soundtracks.

In the interest of fairness, I do want to talk about some of the negatives of the game, and by far my biggest complaint in my experience with Cyberpunk 2077 so far are the controls and the options screen. Listen, I'm going to say this and I want everyone and their mom to write it down. Ready? Okay: [b]FOR PC GAMES, INTERACT SHOULD ALWAYS BE MAPPED TO THE ""E"" KEY[/b]. As you might have guess, this is not the case in Cyberpunk. In this game you interact with the ""F"" key. Now, on almost any other game in the universe, this wouldn't be that big of a deal. The problem is, you can't remap this key. You can remap [i[some[/i] actions, but not all, and interact is not one you can remap from the options screen. Speaking of remapping, whoever designed the remapping screen must have worked at Ubisoft previously because it does the same thing that the latest AC games do where  when remapping keys the screen doesn't pay attention to context. Example: Yes I want to use the same key to turn on the car's radio and to crouch. I don't need to receive an alert message telling me that there's a duplicate key map conflict because you can't fucking crouch in a car. An then sometimes it just flat out won't let you map a key at all.

This brings us to my other main complaint, player movement. It's just so gross! Look, I know a lot of people out there love it when you they're playing a first person game and they look down and can actually see their feet. Me? I hate it. I'll take the old school Lt Dan method any day of the week. Why? Because every time I play a game where I can see my own legs, the quality of player movement just plummets. It's like trying to dribble a hockey puck made of a grape starburst, and it's no different in this game. Then there's picking up loot. I'm not quite sure what the cause is but picking up loot on the ground, or on dead bodies, can be one of the most frustrating things in the game, and that's if you can even see the loot in the first place considering so much of it blends right into the environment. If you can see the loot, the window around it that allows you to press the ""F"" key (errrggghhh) to pick it up is microscopic. I found myself mashing my F key like a madman as I ran between from enemy to enemy. Hell, sometimes you can see the loot but you can't pick it up. That's always fun. Then there's dodging. You dodge by double-tapping left or right but be careful with this because if you accidentally dodge into someone, it's seen as a hostile action.

Enough of that. I don't like focusing on negatives too much, in anything in life really, but that stuff needed to be said. Cyberpunk 2077 [b]is[/b] a good game and I do recommend it, but just know that it still needs a [b]lot[/b] of work and attention from the devs. I'm not worried though. I have faith that CD Projekt Red will come through and they won't pull a Bioware and just abandon a game to its issues *cough* *cough* MassEffectAndromeda *cough* *cough*.

Oh, and I thought that Keanu guy did a pretty good job. If he keeps it up then I reckon he's got a bright future acting in movies in store for him. Time will tell!",True
"The game is beautifully made, just what I was waiting for since the frist Deus Ex.
The quests and stories are superb, immersion is well done.
No game braking bugs, it does have some here, but they aren't really bothersome.

"[h1] Dont buy it... Yet [/h1]

I havent played through the game yet and that wont change for some time.

The game is full of bugs, character clipping through clothes, twin npcs right next to each other, weird npc spawning right infront of you and more + the ones I didnt experience in my 2 hours but other people did. 
This doesnt sound that bad because atleast the ones I got are pretty minor, but this is kind of a death by a thousand cuts and doesnt include the gamebreaking stuff I didnt get.

What makes this game unplayable for me is the fact they force AA probably TAA on you without a setting to change that. 
I tried everything from changing every possible setting in the graphics menu (I was on ultra and tried all the presets and flipped through every possible combination of depth of field on/off, chromatic aberation on/off and film grain on/off; and obviously motion blur), I tried using the AMD GPU driver to overwrite the in game AA settings and it did nothing, tried the same for external sharpening. [b] the game is still a blurry mess [/b].

"This game is really breath taking except for minor performance issues like control glitches and bugs. But these are minor issue, doesn't affect ur gameplay or cost u failing mission. Random crash is not so often(not a big deal).

Sooooooo..... Yeah, here's my new review, recommend this now",True
"[B]GEEZ[/B], I don't even know from where to start writing about this failure, over hyped mess ever, a completely disappointment, a false advertising product all over it, not immersive at all & theee buggs (ohh God, don't even wanna go in that direction) or the minimum specs (don't even try run it with that, it wont work, barely works on some high 1k$+ configurations)... and not to mention that i even preorder it   #big-facepalm.

It looks like not even a mediocre game, except the glittering, fancy textures, ""cool"" graphics (but who cares because that's how it should look a game in 2020+), some other good details here & there and sex/porn ads almost everywhere in game (which seems it's still a must in almost every game, of course you can adjust your thingie btw the legs and hide nipples in character creation but that's it you can't customise the character anymore after this point in game).

To many broken physics, collisions, animations, horrible warrant system & i think the worst Ai I've seen in decades and even if the game wasn't so broken it would be mediocre at best. They attempted to copy several successful games and did it poorly. The ""game"" is completely trash, one of the worse games i've ever played. Its like a bad GTA (there is no such thing) set in the future, but like it was made in the past 20 years ago at best just wrapped in fancy textures, a bs wrapped in gold.

I stopped to play after few hours, i simply can't do it and continue atm or i would start cry of how bad it is but i wont refund it either bcs i'll be waiting for fixes, patches, updates and so on which to make the game enjoyable and playable and actually what Cdpr promised and massive advertised for almost 2 years now. Oh wait, they at least succeed with one thing: ""Whole game is going to be a meme"". - Jul 2, 2018 - source: @CyberpunkGame Twitter.

There are endless reviews of this & that, some on point some not, with negative & positive sides of this game (which imho is not a game but it feels like a story walk simulator where actually there are no big changes you could do, just a lot of blabla you can select. They made it sound like you had so many choices, could do so many things, and it's just not. Plus a bad script of the Keanu one which make him sound horrible and act the same just because of a bad writing.. poor guy.. and his character in game geez what's wrong with his head made it so big ffs).

The gameplay and the world is absolutely empty and dull, streets sometimes are empty (in a futuristic overpopulated area). Don't mind the bugs, performance issues. Don't mind the lackluster buggy cinematics. Don't mind the HIDEOUS INTERFACE. The absolute terrible inventory system. Don't mind that you can't buy cars from a shop or website (doesn't exist), or other stuffs in game like to customise your character and do funny stuffs in this amazing looking city. Don't mind the horrible way of getting side-quests through tireless phone calls, and when you kill the person you were sent there to kill and leave the building the NPC calls you back INSTANTLY, magically knowing about it, before anyone else could find about body or known the target was really killed (can mention here the police that spawns close to you out of no where as well). Don't mind the uncountable times I have been cut from the immersion because so many weird things were happening on the screen, and don't mind the NPC when having a cutscene with deciding to walk through me as if I didn't exist, NUMEROUS times, even when I stood right where the cutscene left me, after giving back the control.

This game is an absolute MESS. I could not believe my eyes. The game gives you a glimpse of what it could've been because it has COOL cinematics while having a drink at the bar, and getting your cybernetic arm upgrades on a cool cutscene, but then it NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. Everytime you upgrade your cybernetic stuff, it's just one horrible menu with stupid icons. Everytime you ask for a drink, a horrible menu opens up so you can buy random uninpressive food icons that all work the same way. And everytime you want to eat something you already have, you have to open your inventory, instead of pushing a button like it is in other games. The food & drinks are definitely disappointing, no point in interacting with it if it's just a regular consumable. No special animations or just dialogue with the bartenders or anything.

First time you carry a body, they show a cool cinematic of laying it on the ground, on your very first mission. But then, forever after, everytime you have to put a body in the trunk of a car, they teleport. NPCs don't even open any doors, ever. NPC's don't open or interact with anything, ever! When they enter a car, the door opens by itself, and I know the door is not automatic because when YOU leave the car, you interact with the door knob. And the NPCs clip THROUGH the door when it's opening or closing, instead of waiting for it. The car usually starts running off before they even sit or put the foot on it. Doors are not physical objects like in GTA for example where you can destroy it detach it from the car if you hit something, here in the amazing CYBERPUNK 2077 it clips through everything !!!

This game "" is "" one of the most immersion braking games and i try being impartial here, forgetting about the hype, threating it like any other game, looking over all the bugs glitches and clunky NPC and bad cutscenes it has, not comparing to anything else, and just looking at it for what it is. And it is absolutely stupid and flatout boring and lacking an infinite of stuffs which should not miss from this game! This game it's really insulting, an open world utter trash, period. Ohh, and why since is MADE IN POLAND, doesn't represent a city from Europe and had to be typical american style one another copycat city-game from NA ?!

I stop here for now better, definitely devs need to do a SERIOUS quality of life update for this game, no wonder they delayed it 2000 times, this game looks at least rushed even if they ""work"" on it for years (if advertising counts as that too), it should not had been released but i believe we all know why it happened in the end, they possible left short on money because of the massive advertising and they released it as we see it.

In the end, no matter of the score game have here & there, critic reviews and idk what else that promote still positive hype about this game, it seems like the advertising fake propaganda is still going on.

Wish i could give it from all my being a huge thumbs up but i can't, i'm not a hypocrite like others and to give a fake review to be part of the false advertising. It is still a 60 euro product and for those which actually care of them hard working earn money i would give them the advise to wait for fixes & updates OR buy it and refund it before 2 hours of ""gameplay"" but considering that the prologue here is at least 2h+ be carefull with that, maybe they did it on purpose so long so could not be refunded after, really tricky this detail too...

If you don't care about all of the mentioned stuffs here (only a little part of them) of course the game could be an interesting experience and look awesome (which it does.. LOOK) but pretty much that's it sadly. The potential is still existing and that's a big hope still!",False
"First review (first 5 hours) (No-Spoilers)

This game is, at least so far, a marriage of ""Deus-Ex"" games and ""Blade Runner"" movie. If you are familiar with those and like them you will love this game. Right from the start before even stepping into the game you start with options that directly impact he play/story. 

GRAPHICS are simply stunning and even though I don't have the latest graphics card it plays smoothly and with no issues.

CONTROLS are the usual first person shooter controls so anyone familiar with FPS games will have no issue getting in to the game right away.

MUSIC is... oh dear god! Even before I start playing I just left it for some time at the main menu just listening to the psychedelic / chill electronic music. If you are in to this type of music you will love it.

GAME SOUND is great and voice acting is top notch so far

Negatives: Some mini glitches like for example on the Character customization when switching between options the mouse will jump to other sections and you will end up changing other settings you don't want to change. Mouth/Voice tracing seems not 100% accurate on all mobs, but this might be just a glitch. Ill update after a few hours of game-play.

OVERALL this game seems to be rightfully heading towards the game of the year award with a 9.5/10 that could be easily made a 10/10 if small glitches are fixed and the game doesn't take a turn towards a dump.

"То ли я уже становлюсь понемногу пожилым геймером и меня тяжело удивить чем-то новым, то ли новые игры не особо то и стараются нас удивить и порадовать, точно могу сказать что киберпунк 2077 не особо меня зацепил. Мир в который тебя погружает игра прикольный, грубо говоря это суп из большого количества идей которые вы наверняка встречали в других играх (к примеру Deus Ex), до психоделики Филиппа Дика (было бы прикольно, если бы игра пыталась тебя убедить что ты и все твои воспоминания это фейк) и фантастики Стругацких им еще далеко. Графоний и качество звука на топовом уровне что не скажешь о геймплее, по началу пытался проходить игру в стелс режиме, но по ходу под такой вариант прохождения игру не особо затачивали, поэтому в итоге бегал с револьвером и ваншотал всех в голову) Рекомендую для разового прохождения, может еще вернусь когда DLC подъедут, а так бегать по городу и фармить NPC не вижу особо смысла.",True

"This is how to fix performance problems do the following:
right click on Cyberpunk 2077 in library go to manage>browse local files
next double click on engine then go to config then double click on memory budgets 
change CPU pool to half or a little bit more of your RAM
change GPU to x number of GB as long as you have one GB of VRAM left then exit.
once you start the game up again loading times will be cut significantly and FPS will be increased. 
It will also increase the graphical settings once these changes have been made.

The game is okay.  I have had fun playing it but I would suggest waiting until they finish it.,False
"Don't be fooled, this is not an open world rpg like they'd have you believe, and here's why:

- There are almost no random encounters. The one and only random encounter I experienced was witnessing a police shootout that you could choose to partake in. You can't eat at restaurants, almost none of the vendors can actually sell you things, and talking to NPCs typically just results in them blurting out expletives at you.

- AI is non-existent. Cars will only follow a set path, and will not attempt to get around you when you stop. NPC's seem to have just 4 states: walk, crouch in fear, run, or do some preset animation. Also, the police will not chase you, they simply appear out of thin air if you commit a crime.

- The gun-play is atrocious and enemies become bullet sponges depending on your level. IMO this is the most egregious of all this games sins, as it is the core gameplay mechanic. I was completely baffled when in one of the beginning main story missions I had to shoot an enemy point blank in the head (and this is not an exaggeration) 10 times to kill them. It makes the gunplay in Fallout look expertly crafted by comparison. 

Aside from these very real problems however, the story and side story missions are entertaining and the story is good. If you treat this game as a more linear experience you'll likely have a better time.",False

"Quite simply this game is spectacular. I very rarely pay full price for a game these days but in this case i did just that and i did not regret it for a second. I ordered it and pre-loaded the game ready for release day.

 I have had a great 80 hours of game play at the time of writing this review and i am far from finished playing the game. There are loads more side missions to do - they have a decent enough variety between car races, break ins, sabotage, stealth hacks or run and gun baby.

The graphics are stunning - excellent detail in all areas and it looks amazing even during the fast paced action sequences. There are graphical bugs at this time such as a few T shape models during loads or missing weapons in hands etc - patch 1.04 is the one released at time of the review and i guarantee from this company they will work hard to keep updates coming. 

Despite this i personally say this game is very stable on a high end PC even at ultra settings - you may need to tone it down a bit on other older machines but it does not deserve the stick it has had to date for ""bugs"" - more so i believe people are playing AAA games like this just at recommended settings on machines that are full of dust and probably viruses or background tasks which cause software issues. Have a look at the state of you machine and just what clutter is on it before instantly slamming the developers - or are you good enough to write code and design a game of this magnitude and standard?!

No - thought not.

Further patches will be released to correct these current (at time of writing) minor issues i am positive.

There is loads of replay value to be had - in terms of side missions and alternative paths during the main quests. Just completing the game once is not all there is to get from it.You can go back and play it over again if you have another 100 hours to sink your life into Night City!

Difficulty levels are decent enough - challenging at higher levels and in game you are advised which missions are too much for you at any given level (same idea as Witcher 3 since it is the same development team).

Deus Ex meets Witcher 3 (maybe) but its a fantastic game to play.

Highly recommended game - worth the price. Also Keanu Reeves.

I said - Keanu Reeves.",True
"Wait for a price drop and more patches, I doubt CDPR will be capable of giving back all the features it promised. 

In its current state, despite its good story, Cyberpunk is an underwhelming buggy mess and resembles nothing like the gameplay demo CDPR had demonstrated. It lacks basic features that were present in games released from the PS2 era. 

It needed at least another year before it was released. This is unacceptable. 

-Police spawn exactly where you commit the crime and are easy to escape from

-Stupid NPC ""AI"" that just walk or stand around doing one activity the whole day. No ""day/night cycles""

-3rd person mode is completely missing

- only one safehouse in the whole game. You can't buy properties. 

-looks customization is minimal and can't be changed in the future

-very little differences in player lifepaths

- physics are terrible as well as no destructible environments (completely changed from the demo)

- no wall running with the mantis blades

- 90% of the ""big"" player choices don't impact the ending 

- no ability to shoot out of vehicles

- there's verticality but there's no ability to explore the giant skyscrapers with flying vehicles. (even the map size is small)

- objects pop in and out of existence even on high settings 

- objects explode for no reason

- many NPCs are stuck in a perpetual T pose

- the game runs awful even on a GTX 1060 (recommended specs) and is unplayable on current gen 
consoles. I had two crashes. 

- animations are choppy and graphics are not impressive unless you have a 3000 series graphics card which are all out of stock

- no environmental takedowns

- no inspection system

- you can't rob stores

- weapon stats are just DPS and damage (not what they advertised)

- interactions with NPCs and activities are far from being deep or immersive

Hugely disappointing game that gives very little satisfaction on completion (and I even got the ""best ending""). There's very little replay value. Even though the visuals are gorgeous at times(I don't even have ray tracing),  this game is still not worth 60 dollars. I still have to complete some side missions and try to get all the endings in this short, albeit, entertaining story.

"I'm not sure where to start with Cyberpunk 2077, this game has many problems starting with bugs and optimization to gameplay and story building. Keep in mind when reading this I had lower expectations than most with this game but still believed it would have been a good game, just not as good as everyone was hyping it up to be. When first beginning my adventure into Cyberpunk I walk outside the starting car to 2 different groups of thugs floating on top of each other's heads. Given that was on the first day of release I don't mind too much considering every game these days are released with a butt load of bugs and eventually problems like this will be fixed, not only did I find these thugs floating as soon as I exited the door, NPCs are clipping through elevators, doors, and walls while talking with me and getting to their destination. Optimization is also a complaint for many, I don't understand why the recommended specs for this game involve a 1060, no matter what graphics settings I change the game still has nearly the same performance, but again this is common in many games so I'm not going to fault Cyberpunk specifically for this problem, just something I wish many games would resolve. That being said I have a 1080 and an I7 7700k and only getting a max of 60fps when playing on medium settings only about 5 fps more than playing with everything set to max. Speaking of graphics this game doesn't seem to be special in any regard with their graphics, and I actually recommend you check out this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DWTWBpXZV8 to see the differences between ultra and low, sometimes it seems as though lower is better just to reduce the amount of blur they use when on ultra, and it seems as though there is no real significant difference when playing on one or the other. I thought amazing atmosphere and breathtaking visuals was something Cyberpunk was striving to get. But these visuals are simply not impressive, they aren't bad either but after taking a break from the game I went off to Red Dead Redemption 2 and man the difference was night and day graphically speaking. 

  


Onto the gameplay, at the very beginning aside from the bugs I was roped in, the story was really nice and the graphics seemed impressive at that point but once you get 2 hours in you walk out of your apartment ready to take on the world, the atmosphere here is fantastic I felt like a little boy in the middle of a huge open world. Hopped in my car and drove around... with nearly nothing to do. I figured well it is the beginning I was just introduced to the world I'll do a few more missions and see what more opens up, I meet new people get more mechanics thrown at me and at that point it changed nearly nothing. Just more upgrades and neat gadgets to do things with that were niche at best. Hacking only gives you 3 options after beginning the game, attack, distract, or take over. Take over cameras, hack into people and damage them, or activate a light, T.V. or forklift to distract the enemy. It is nearly useless to use these mechanics unless you want to distract the exact same copy pasted bulletsponges. Not to mention when you hack someone and blow up their phone or cyberware and damage them, they do not bat an eye unless you actually see you. You can hack, wait a minute hack again, until they are dead. This right here I thought was a bit embarrassing, they don't even try to walk around and find you, its similar to Skyrim NPCs getting hit with an arrow and believing it was their imagination. Once I even had a civilian drive near a turf shootout and sit there, staring at us shooting instead of panicking, driving off, she sat there because my car was stuck in the way in front of tens of guys shooting near her. I truly feel like GTA V NPCs were more impressive and that game came out in 2013. There are also ""Cyberpsychos"" who were really hyped up in the first side mission to be cool diverse murdering cops and innocents then retreating into their little cave but I quickly found out after fighting 3 of them, they are exactly the same and even the AI here is a bit wacky. You fire an entire magazine into them and they magically dodge half the bullets that are being fired straight into them. Their AI is also only programmed to stay in one specific spot. If you get out of their fight zone they'll stand there and let you keep firing or hack to your hearts content.

Finally the story, I thought the very introduction was really interesting at first, as I said it roped me in gave the characters some personality and hyped me up for a really nice solo experience, until I finished the introduction and found my way into Nightcity. Once I awoke and started my adventure it just felt like a chore, I'm sitting with someone talking about a job who tells me to get in a car and talk with someone about a job I then murder for said object then sit with someone and talk about a job. Granted I'm only 4ish hours into the story but so far I just can't tell what's happening and I just don't seem to care about whats happening. Its just job to job and for some reason the big ""boss"" giving out jobs cares about specifically me for no real reason, when confronted with the question he just says I'm more trustworthy when I just met the guy. The only praise I can say with this story is within these fetch quests is the mini-stories there are really cool and don't seem super scripted. It felt really interactive when choosing my dialogue then something would happen and I'm slowly regretting that decision. But on the decision side of things I suppose this could be a slight spoiler so beware, [spoiler]everyone gets their own introduction when playing but after the intro everyone is put into the exact same spot, so not every experience seems like it will be tailored into your own unique story.[/spoiler]

Finishing this review off I just want to say that Cyberpunk 2077 really has the atmosphere and world building for a great game but because the gameplay and story lacks so much I don't know what this game could become, the open world really seems nearly dead with every side quest seeming to be exactly the same with random punks wanting to kill you for scraps. There is so much left to be desired with this game and the gameplay is nothing shy of a B tier ubisoft game, truly it feels like Watchdogs-The Division but I suppose that's giving it some praise because at least Watchdogs had really cool unique things with their hacks. But pretty much that's about what I have to say. Thank you to anyone for reading, I do not recommend this game in its current state and it seems like it would take quite a bit of time for the game to really be something special, though in the end I am happy the team hopefully gets a small break after being in crunch mode for over a year. I'll definitely give this game another shot over time and update my review accordingly since I want this to be as accurate as it can be.",False
"Not great, definitely did not get what was promised. Even closing my eyes on all the bugs, the story was bland and linear. 

Keanu's character felt out of place and made the main character look bipolar (He argues and curses at Silverhand and minutes later calls for his help and talks to him like they have been buddies for 20 years).

I really was under the impression that there would be repercussions for relying too much on cyberware and we would face a dilemma between improving our body and losing humanity.

No choices mattered in the end at all. Yeah you may have multiple endings and have variety in outcomes to quests, it was all however very minor. Comparing to the choices that had to be made in Witcher, this is child's play.

Things are unlikely to change as it appears that the developer is proud of the PC version of the game apart from the bugs. I take it as there will be bug fixes in the future and some DLCs (cars and hats perhaps?) but the deeper issues will never be addressed.

I hope I am wrong.",False

"TL;DR BUYERS BEWARE!!!!

It's a mystery to me how anyone in their right mind or who played actually good rpgs, looter shooters or open world games in the last 20 years can recommend this game.
At launch Cyberpunk 2077 is a bug riddled mess with broken half baked systems and with obviously missing content.
If you have a mid to high-end rig it looks good at least.
I really wanted to like this game despite of the well documented flaws posted all over the internet.
If you for some reason read my review I urge you NOT to buy this game at this point in time, NOT for 60 bucks not for 30.
Wait until CDPR or the modding community fixes this dumpster fire if it's even possible.

But honestly if you want to play a good game and not a 'great potential', avoid this like the plague.",False
"[h1] Do not play if you are already in a bad mental state. [/h1] 

Not even going to talk about the bugs or whatever.

Gameplay itself, when it works, is fun. Lots of options to handle mechanics. Driving in a bike around city is nice.

But I cannot emphasis enough that if you are in any kind of negative headspace [b] do not play this game.[/b]

Nothing you do matters. There is no happy ending. Prologned side quests where you can come to like side certain NPCS always results in you being unable to do a damn thing to help them. Lots of people would rather off themselves.  

Shoot. Your own ending is a choice between [spoiler]murdered, suicide, or possession. [/spoiler]

You get no happy ending. No one gets a happy ending. Your choices don't matter. You can't help anyone. You mean nothing in this game. You lose everything. 

If you want to feel depressed, nihilistic, or put yourself in a bad headspace play away.",False
Kinda reminds me of saints row 3 but more enhanced and cyber-e . You can also make a futa in the game.. havent went far into the game but sometimes you get quick choice dialogs. My advice is sometimes do the side mission optional  quest prior to the main one.... who knows. Could probably  save your life,True
this game not so bad but i like roblox better,False
"Disappointed. Side quests, main quest and the graphics are the only redeeming factors for me. Everyone puts in amazing performances voice wise and the game is the best looking game to be released to date imo. Radio stations are really cool too. The only exception to this is Johnny Silverhand. He's shit as a character. I'm sorry but he just is and as breathtaking as Keanu Reeves is his monotone voice just puts me to sleep when I hear it.

Performance is not up to par at all. Some settings apparently do nothing at all for FPS while some absolutely TANK it while giving little benefits. Side gigs and jobs are lackluster and just copy and paste cookie cutter missions. Surely they could have done better here.

No proper wanted system with cops? Really? Cops will just spawn behind you as soon as you commit a crime and disappear within seconds. There are no car chases in the open world at all, cops sometimes spawn inside walls etc. etc. etc.

NPC AI is absolute garbage too. Enemies will just stand there like idiots taking hits like sponges. General crowd AI is the same.

The life path choices mean NOTHING except for lore purposes. Some unique dialog options that don't really matter in the story and that's about it besides the intro. May as well have not included it.

In game economy is absolute trash. Some guns can cost upwards of 180K and they sell for peanuts. Clothes follow no logic at all in terms of armour rating and looking back at one of the trailers where they show off the fashion in Night City along with vehicles and lifepaths, none or very little of that fashion is accessible to you. Most stores sell the same looking shit and I've found no cool outfits so far. I was really looking forward to the fashion too.

Driving is absolutely atrocious. Cars feel way too floaty and have no real weight to them. Even a slight turn at speed will cause you to crash into someone/something. Races are gibbed with the cars you're racing against teleporting randomly right behind and sometimes in front of you as soon as you're 1st meaning if you make one little mistake, you lose. What's really dumb is that the MAP DOES NOT ZOOM TF OUT WHEN DRIVING AT SPEED SO YOU'RE CONSTANTLY MISSING YOUR EXIT.

Character creator is lacking although I was able to create a decent character anyway. I just wish they'd put more thought into it. Gunplay is okay. Just okay. Hacking is clunky as all hell and it put me right off so I just defaulted to gunning my way past everything.

A lot of elements look to have been roughly pulled from TW3 and shoved into here. The inventory menu while familiar, should have been given an overhaul. It's old and clunky feeling for me. The runes system from TW3 has also been ported to clothes here and it's just old CDPR, it's been done already. Think of something NEW for your fresh, NEW IP. 

I hate the fact that crafting anything halfway decent is locked behind a fucking skill tree. This part they could have copied from TW3 and it would have been a TON better. Bugs galore and i've never given other devs a pass before but even after numerous delays with the ""When it's ready....."" release date they kept parroting at us, it feels like a slap in the face to be honest.

I wouldn't recommend this game in it's current state although there is an excellent game in there somewhere. If CDPR can fix the performance issues and bugs then I can see it becoming a classic. I hope they don't add in the missing features and content as part of any future DLC though.

"Before I start talking, let me warn you that this review is coming from a dude who hasn't touched anything but cyberpunk for the last 9 days and is a huge cdpr fan. Yet I assure you, you can expect more objectivity from a guy like me than some random critic who rushed the whole game just to put up a review. 

Let me talk briefly about what can you expect from this game. A well-written and performed storyline with realistic, believable characters in an immersive [u] yet [/u] at times feels like an unfinished world. Yes, this game is not just about going wild and shooting everybody, it also tries to teach you and perhaps shape your perspective into questioning your morality, humanity and even your status-quo. Although the game very frequently struggles with technical issues like weird glitches, bugs, clipping errors, lack of animations, it [b] however [/b] holds up to what you can expect from a very intriguing story. 

All the story elements aside, you may ask how the story and immersive world translates into the gameplay. Well, let me tell you, [u] this game is nothing but an RPG [/u] RPG elements are implemented into the gameplay in a way that I've never, ever witnessed it before. Like being able to hijack cars that are tech-heavy and super modernized thanks to the technical attributes or to going berserk mode by jumping off a high building to knock [b] everything [/b] around you. But to do those amazing moves, your body needs to handle the cyberware you are putting on yourself. So for example, if you don't put any attributes to your body, you can't implant certain cyberwares. Same goes for any other attribute points like reflexes, tech, intelligence, maybe except cool. 

The combat is easy to get into with the exception of some guns, they all feel like you're actually  [u] in control [/u] Same applies to melee weapons like katanas or baseball bats etc. They all feel unique and thought-provoking. However, I wouldn't say the same about the fistfights and all that. I simply did not put any upgrades into the street brawler just because I didn't feel obligated. If you're not aiming to be a superhuman futuristic rocky balboa, the street brawler perks are simply useless in most of the games combat sessions.

Now comes the part where I talk about how the game [u] in all its fullness [/u] feels somewhat empty, unfinished and nearly impossible to interact. There are a ton of side activities you can do in this game, like holy hell, it's still not the witcher 3 amount though it's pretty much close. And yet cyberpunk, even though it had many, many chances to create interactive activities. There are no mini-games in the open world, nothing to interact with, or in other words, there is barely anything attractive to spend your dirty money. Even the coolest aspects of the game such as brain dances are strictly exclusive to main missions. Let me give you another example, there are sooo many vendors who sell you drinks, meals, dildos or even straight-up brain dance lewd stuff [b] HOWEVER [/b] they are ALL useless. Most of the drinks and meals have the same effect and that they don't even feel reasonable to deal with. The other stuff I mentioned, ALL useless... If you buy them, they straight up sit in your inventory the whole game. Unless you want to take advantage of the games' crafting system, even the drinks are useless. You can't interact with Atari games, pools and much other good stuff around you. In all it's glory, cyberpunk feels unfinished. So many of the promises are either removed from the game or hasn't been implemented at all. 

Last but not least, the performance issues I had with this game was obnoxious. I have a 2060 super with ryzen 5 3600x and yet the game acts like as if I'm playing on windows vista or something. When I boot up the game with nearly ultra settings and medium rt, it holds up to 70 to 80fps [b] at the start [/b] but then after a couple of hours, it simply kicks my butt and decreases to 20 to 30. Yes, you heard it right. It's unbelievable. And the funny thing is, if I boot up the game again (after a certain decrease) it cranks it up to 80fps all over again. So yeah, it has performance issues which suck to see but overall, I managed to dig deep in this game and %100 it like it was nothing. 

So after all the shinanigans, I mentioned with this game, why did I give it a positive review you may ask... It's just simply because it is CD project Red and I have faith in them that they'll not only fix the game but also they'll improve the game in a way that after some time, it'll be a whole another experience. These guys are hard workers and they deserve every credit they can get. Even though I'm a huge fan of them, I tried to remain unbiased and objective throughout this review. There are so many things I left behind mentioning like how the voice actings, songs are top-notch but unfortunately, after all, this is a videogame and when a video game doesn't play right, you can't fully appreciate the art, passion and hard work, like you used to. Anyway, all I'm saying guys, if you perhaps give it a month or two, I believe they can refurbish most of the issues in the game, and maybe in a couple of months, we'd start seeing new content or perhaps the thing they promised before.

Overall the game was amazing and had a great story with engaging side missions.  It had bugs, but nothing that couldn't be fixed by a quick reload.  It was worth the 8 year wait, and I probably would have been happy to wait a few more years for a perfect release.  Either way I'm happy with the ""mostly"" finished product.

The graphics on the 1660 Ti looked smooth and it was playable using the recommended settings.  I originally got this on PS4 but quickly traded it in to get it on Steam.  I'm happy with my choice.

Looking forward to a New Game + and some DLC to keep going back to try out different builds.  It does lack some replayability as the quests are pretty much the same.

Would recommend to friends and strangers.",True
"With the size of games these days, it is completely understandable for content to have some issues at launch. Cyberpunk 2077 is no different. Yes, there are some bug here at the beginning of it's life. One time I got a bug that prevented me from continuing the main quest even. Though usually, reloading your save can fix these minor issues. Weird animations, characters floating, HUD glitches. These are all common bugs that I can easily overlook, as we all know, the Witcher 3 launch was the same way. Witcher 3 is now considered one of the best gaming experiences of our time.

I believe Cyberpunk 2077 to be legit one of the best RPGs I have ever played. I came into the game blind, avoiding all info and gameplay. 

The characters feel alive, so does the environment. It has been quite some time since I could say I woke up excited to play a game. I want to explore it and continue the experience more and more each time I play it. The creators have devoted a huge amount of time to refining the city, it is wonderful and it feels alive.

I think in some time I will be able to say that it is 10/10",True

"We all got cyberpunk'd by these scammers. Unfortunately, the game is a lot different to what was promised. The ridiculously high metacritic score is a joke and undeserved... even if you didn't see any of the demos or developer videos from previous years it's not hard to see that this game is just bland and over-hyped garbage. 

Fuck this dollar store futuristic GTA.

Cyberpunk 2077 more like Cyberpunk 2007, CDPR fix your shit!",False
"Visually and lore wise the game is stunning, a lot of effort on details, but after playing it for a while I realized that around 30% ~40% of the game is not working as intended. The bugs varies from visual, perks, items, AI, mechanics, etc. Moreover, some can break the main quest line disabling the completion of the game. I had to recreate my character multiple times and save scum a lot in order to finish all the content.

By their last statement, CDPR will focus on making the game playable in the old gen consoles before addressing the bugs and balance of the game, so if you bought the game already, go ahead and play it, since the fixes will take a while, but if you didn't maybe hold up and wait an year.",False
"First of all, I didn't join the hype train or have a massive expectation like most people. I'm interested in this game purely because I love cyberpunk-themed series such as Blade Runner, AKIRA, Ghost in the Shell, The Matrix, Deus Ex, Psycho-Pass, Altered Carbon, and many more.

Second, I'm not expecting a next-gen GTA like most people do because of some similarities (metropolis setting, shooter, and cars). So I will not comparing these two, my enjoyment and opinion are purely based on what is IN the game itself.

Here is my opinion on the game so far, things that I really like:
- Night City is so beautiful and mesmerizing. It truly captures the aesthetics and futuristic retro vibes from a lot of cyberpunk movies. Definitely one of the most dense, complex, and detailed (fictional) city design on video games to date.
- The story in this game is amazing and compelling. Sometimes the pacing might be too slow and have a lot informations to be processed (basically just like most cyberpunk movies), but it's a really well written and very emotional. The characters is also likeable and had a lot of depth to them.
- The soundtrack of this game is unexpectedly very good! It covers a lot of different emotions in various genre. I mean who doesn't love Never Fade Away, or maybe the best one of all, PonPon Shit?
- Honestly I'm not really into FPS games but I didn't expect that I have so much of fun with Cyberpunk 2077 combat. It is really fast paced, with lot of various play styles (from full gun blasting, katana slashing, sniping, hacking, stealth, etc.) depending on my character build.

Negative aspects or maybe some things that can be improved in the future:
- The main story is too short. They should've expand more each lifepaths campaign, branching storyline, and characters arc. Although they compensate it with so many side quests/gigs, but still I hope they improve this aspects on the upcoming DLCs.
- The bugs and glitches. Though honestly it doesn't bother me too much since no game breaking bugs at all even on my low-end PC. It doesn't ruin my overall enjoyment but yeah, sometimes it's kind of annoying.
- Lack of interactions to the world, such as shops, food stands, personal properties, vehicle, character customization, etc. Not really an important aspect of the game, but it's such a waste of potential to the amazing detailed open world in this game.
- NPC AI need a lot of improvement. With the nature of its setting, it's very understandable to have sooo many people (lifeless NPCs) on the streets, just like in most cyberpunk stories. But at least make it more believable, because I found a lot of duplicated NPCs in the same area. Their reaction to violence or crimes also could be improved.

After some hours into the game, I can say for sure that Cyberpunk 2077 is not the second coming of jesus or even the greatest game ever like how the internet overhyped it before, and it's definitely not as horrible as what internet hate bandwagon says right now. Cyberpunk as a genre itself is pretty much niche and not that popular compared to other Science fiction sub-genres (such as alien, robot, parallel universe, time travel, space, etc). For me who really like cyberpunk themed series, I really appreciate what CDPR tried to deliver with this game, although it unfortunately doesn't lived up to the expectations they built themselves. But I personally think this game still did a great job on its amazing open world setting and story. The gameplay is also really fun and enjoyable, albeit quite lacking in the role-playing aspect.

With all of the issues plaguing this game currently, Cyberpunk 2077 is nowhere near a ground breaking game, but it's definitely a good game on its own with so much potential in future patches/updates. Props to the developer team for bringing the cyberpunk world to life. But for the executives on CDPR, *sigh* you guys should learn a lot from this disastrous game release.",True

"To begin with, This review will have no spoilers outside of character creation, but will have game mechanic discussions. This game, at least on PC isn't the buggy unplayable mess people make it out to be. There was also a lot of negativity towards the concept of the game, but the games premise is a dystopia, you arn't supposed to like it. Its a world where corperations rule the world and its people are just gears in the machine, used and gotten rid of when they break. Coperations will do anything and everything to make money and get an edge over their competition, whether through over sexualizing ads, espionage, killing the competition, or anything else that suits their agenda. The streets are filled with people barely getting by and many of which turn to crime to make ends meat. With all the criminals roaming the streets mercenary work is all over the place. You choose a starting path at character creation which determines where you start in the world, though overall it doesn't have a huge effect on the story or gameplay as regardless of your path you are one of these mercenaries. This is the world of cyberpunk. 

The story isn't bad, but i also did two completionist runs so I got to experience all of the different aspects of the story. Overall the story didn't feel as strong as the witcher 3, and all over felt a bit rushed at times while very slow at other times. Personally i ended up not doing the story missions until i was out of things to do on the map which lead to huge gaps of no story. I do wish the extra side stuff had something more to do with the story or at least had some effect on how things play out, but they are just there to do if you want and are entirely skippable.

The gameplay mechanics i actually really enjoyed, i played it on very hard both playthroughs. when it comes down to it though there are 2 types of playthroughs. To use the in game terms they are the netrunner and the solo. I will start off with what i did my first playthrough which is the netrunner, this pretty much entails hacking enemies, robots, cameras, and other objects. In the end this actually felt like what you would call a mage in other games which is kind of a cool parallel. The solo is a combination of focusing on either guns or melee weapons. There are stealth options but i feel that because of the way the game works its almost part of the two mentioned playstyles. This is only exasperated by the cold blood tree as i found it to be incredibly good regardless of playstyle and its based off the cool skill, which is also linked to the stealth skill, so both my characters were good at stealth without actually focusing on it. As far as each playstyle goes through, they are all solid leading to some deus ex style solving where you decide how to handle each situation.

The gameplay mechanics lead to the next issue i had which is skill progression as with getting an attribute point every level you could max out 3 of the 5 attributes so it wasnt really a matter of choosing what you wanted your character to be good at as much as choosing what you wanted your character to be bad at or you could be a jack of all trades with. As an example of this i will mention that 20 is the highest a skill can go and 3 is the lowest you can leave it. So extreme examples would be four 14's and a 15, a 3 three 16s and a 20, or even just a 3 an 8 and three 20's. In both my playthroughs i ran one skill at 3 which is what i mentioned above of just choosing what my character was bad at rather than what kind of character i was making.

Next part of the gameplay i wanted to mention is equipment as there are a few oddities. First i wanted to talk about armor and armor mods, i found that the only thing that actually mattered was armor slots as armor value fell so far behind armor mod value that it didn't matter if the item was far inferior in armor value. end game most armor pieces have either 100 armor or 200 armor depending on the piece, however the armor clothing mod is worth 240 the first slotted item in the game has more armor than any piece of armor in the game. This fact is why armor slots are so important and why i wish it was better balanced. In short armor values are so far behind armor mods that armor might as well not have actual armor value. My first playthough i was getting flatlined super fast when i hit max level despite having max level armor, however when i made my own armor mods and tossed them in, my armor value tripled and i survived no problem.

Lastly related to gameplay i wanted to talk about cybernetics as they are something that i think are actually fantastic. There are enough of them that you have to choose, and you are limited to where you have allocated your attributes. The different options allow change the way you play dramatically, double jump for instance is something that changes the way you look at problems entirely. That said i found a few options are very lackluster and not worth picking over the other options. A quick example of this is the rare version of the fortified ankles vs the double jump as the double just is superior in every way.

I would like to address the bugs in the current version of the game. I noted that it wasn't an unplayable mess, but i did get some non-game breaking bugs. I feel like many of the community have picked specific examples of bad bugs and thats all people talk about when most people don't get those bugs. Most bugs i ran into were resolved with a quicksave and then reloading, restarting, or just ignoring it as it wasn't game breaking. Probably the most bizzare bug i ran into is that my car had no car collision, it wasn't really a problem, just strange. This is how i would describe most bugs in this game, just kinda strange. I also noticed more bugs the more time i went without reloading or restarting the game, so its possible a lot of the bugs reported are after leaving the game on for quite a while. Probably the best thing to say is to quicksave often and you can recover from just about anything.

Overall this game was fantastic and i expect that it will be given several patches over the next few months to deal with bugs and framerate. Currently i would give it a 8 out of 10, which should be noted with my two completionist runs within the first two months of the game being out. If/When they fix the obvious bugs i would up that to a 9 out of 10. It certainly has its issues, but i don't expect them to be there forever (looking at you roach on the roof). The world is dark and gritty and there's often no happy solution to resolve everything leaving you with a decision that's not a clearcut black and white issue, the game leaves things in the grey sometimes forcing you to decide the lesser of two evils. I would call this game the child of deus ex and grand theft auto in a universe where nobody is a clear cut good person. If you arn't a fan of games that don't always allow for a ""good"" resolution this probably wont be for you.",True
"Coming from someone whose favourite games are like Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, and Fallout: New Vegas...... this game is great. It's worth playing. It ain't perfect but if you actually like RPGs, you'd be doing yourself a disservice to skip this one. I run it on a decent-but-not-amazing gaming PC and I had some very minor visual glitches (floating cigarettes mostly) and maybe 2 crashes throughout nearly 200 hours of gameplay. I'm not gonna defend the console launch, though, because there's no excuse for that. 

The Good:
1- V's voice acting. Both male and female V are amazing and believable. Some RPGs with a voiced protagonist fail to feel like a coherent character. The minor downside to this is that V has a personality and you are confined within it to some extent, just like Mass Effect's protagonist or Geralt in the Witcher. You definitely have some influence on the character, but V is not a blank slate and it's actually a good thing because you end up with Dragon Age's Inquisitor when you try to add voice acting to a blank character and we don't want a repeat of that shit.

2- Storytelling/Plot. The game has some majour themes that are present from the start and some great foreshadowing about the game's endings. The main characters you interact with are well-written, especially Johnny Silverhand, Judy, and Panam.  The endings range from outright sad to barely bittersweet, which is appropriate for the setting. Night City is a terrible place and yet people are drawn to it... even the player. The only other game to give me the same feeling after finishing the main story was Enderal. It's a difficult experience to capture, and it has left me thinking about the game's ending for days after finishing it.

3- Majour NPC Design and Animations. The people you talk to look amazing and have some really great character quirks in their animations. You definitely should not be skipping through dialogue on a first play through.

The Bad: 
1- NPC AI. Yeah it's not good. Enemies are sluggish sometimes. I can sometimes run up to people with a katana out and kill two of their friends in front of them before they start actually reacting to my presence. Random NPCs throughout the city are goofy as fuck, too, but that can be ignored easily at least.

2- The Police and Crime System. Cops just teleport in when you commit a crime for some reason. You're safe if you drive off because the cops have no driving AI apparently. Dumb AF, but doesn't have an impact on the game's main story.

3- Difficulty, or Lack thereof. Played on 'Very Hard' which is the highest difficulty setting. The first hour you feel like you don't do shit, but after that there was pretty much no challenge in the game. I actually screwed up my build really badly too and didn't have the points to do crafting to get the actual good gear, and I still breezed through the game after getting even a small amount of skill points. I did have to change my playstyle to defeat the 'secret ending' which involves a solo battle against a bunch of enemies that are always max level--but I blame that on my poor build choices. And once I changed the weapon I was using, it went back to being a joke. I'm not really too mad about the difficulty being weak because I'd prefer that over bullet spongey enemies, but it was boring to finish up side quests at max level.

Overall, I'd give it 8/10 (on PC) and I will definitely be playing DLC when we get it. Also we better get a damn barbershop added because I restarted after 7 hours on my first character because I couldn't stand the awful hair choice I had made. ._.

"I'm not going to touch any technical aspects of this game, you've probably already know all about them on the Internet. 
This review will be concentrated on the game itself.
There are two basic approaches toward the cyberpunk genre these days. The first is mostly cosmetical: flashy, neon-violet colors, 80s music, 80s philosophy and a huge pile of nostalgia for millenials remembering the past days when they were still young. There is nothing bad with that style, but that just it: a style. The more serious way is connected to the authors trying to stick to the cyberpunk philosophy: the conflict between the person and the constantly changing world where the big money tries to control your very soul. This conflict is a fuse for a lot of great stories.
And I certainly believe that Cyberpunk 2077 is one of such stories.
At the surface level you see a simple story of a simple merc climbing the cruel ladder of success in Night city. This life is usually relatively short, shorter even compared to such a violent place like the world of Cyberpunk 2020. The second layer is the past. The collective image of the past eras, Johnny Silverhand. He's reincarnation of the anti-hero of the 80s - a relentless rockerboy on the path of revenge. His interactions with V and the world is what makes this story so unique. It's a conflict again: a conflict between rebellion and pregmatism, between a great person and the mundane world, between radical dreamers and down-to-earth survivalists.
But the true identity of this game is at the bottom, it's what makes ths game a contemporary masterpiece. Cyberpunk 2077 sticks to the foundation of this genre: a dystopian future where everything crumbles in the path of a raging corporative beast devoiring the world in its ever growing hunger. The main anthagonist of the game is not a person or a Dark Lord, it's a collective image of corporations which has taken over the world and they cannot be stopped. Yes, cyberpunk genre was always critical towards capitalism in its extreme, final forms. And it's growing ever disturbing how the real world is changing  into just that dark future.
So, Cyberpunk is a great game. It a true cyberpunk. But what else? It's a ls a good story, actually quite a collection of them. But it's also a small world which makes you return to the Night city again. It's alive and it's believable. You immerse into it and after resurfacing after almost 200 hours you will regret that is just a game that has its limitations. I personally want that CDPR would stick to the game for a while. I want them to create more stories in this immersive world. There is so much potential, so I will definitely wait for more.",True
"Nice world, horrible AI",False
"Ignoring the hype and the controversy, this game is really stinkin' good. It has lots of flaws, and you basically require a decent PC to fully enjoy it, or one of the new consoles. The game is missing lots of content, and you can tell certain questlines were cut due to time restrictions. And lots of people have had lots of crashes. But when the game works, and when you're actually playing, rather than reloading saves due to bugs, it's a blast. The writing and characters are super well done, gunplay is solid and satisfying, and creating your ideal build is tons of fun. 
If you can run the game, I highly recommend. Thankfully, CDPR seems very set on improving the game, and with free DLC coming soon, I can only feel excited.
And it's gorgeous, even on medium settings.",True
"Good main story, beauitful city/environment. Shooting/melee was pretty fun, too. 

Negatives: Incredibly dumb AI (worse than GTA San Andreas), dumb enemy AI, no police chases, city sometimes looks like a PS2 environment. Bad physics and attention to detail. Map is crammed full of icons and objectives and becomes overwhelming. Bad driving controls. Can't ride the cool futuristic train and can't pilot/ride the hovercrafts except for missions. I was expecting much more from this game. I think it would have been better if it weren't open world, because the open world to me felt quite lifeless and fake compared to other open world games. However, the story and environmental design make this game worth recommending.
6/10, try to nab it for $30 or less",True
"After Platinum-ing this game, I feel I've got a decent, objective view of it now. To make it easy, I'll break it down into Pros and Cons, as far as what it does well, what it doesn't, etc..

TL;DR: 
Objectively, yes, an unpolished product, but still enjoyable, so I'll give it 2 ratings:
Enjoyment: 8 out of 10 (Personally, at least)
Objective view of the game's mechanics/systems: 5 out of 10

Now, if you want the full one, here it is!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pros:
- Attributes and Perk Tree (For the most part, at least)
           - The level of creativity the game allows you to explore with builds and such is top-shelf, as far as options go, at least. (My personal favorite build is a mix of Cool and Reflexes. Basically, I could take out Mantis Blades, running around at Mach-12, with over 5000+ armor, stacked resistances, and healing, OR with the same build, I could opt to be stealthy with a Sniper and get over 200k+ dmg headshot crits through walls. 10/10 recommend). But, I can't say that while there are a LOT of options, not all of them are good. EX: Technical ability comes handy in some situations (doors, etc.), but putting points into the actual Attribute offers little (just armor), and the perk trees have little to offer in terms of combat utility, and you have to go DEEP into the attribute to get anything decently useful (i.e., crafting Legendaries requires the stat to be at level 18, a large portion of your Attribute points from leveling). 
- Story
       - Besides some of the memes, I actually feel the story was quite well done, and reflected a decent amount of effort! (Side note: It's insane to think about just how much text there is if you combine all of those shards in the game! Hats off to that team!) Personally, I was actually pleasantly surprised to see the twist once you learn about the Biochip in your head and such. 
- Side jobs/gigs
        - The part of the game that *really* shined for me was the side quests. Some of them were such a treat! Talking gun? Check. Soda machine that is near-sentient and explicates your existential conundrum? Check! This game was absolutely TEEMING with things to do, so you'll never be bored. 
- Glitches/Bugs
       - Now, I know most of you are probably thinking: ""Wait, did he mess up the formatting? Are we in the Cons list now?"" No, and, surprisingly, not yet. While of course I'll talk about the glitches/bugs as a Con, I also felt they made the game a lot more fun, and gave a lot of players unique experiences! Personally, my most memorable moment was when I climbed up the side of a building, and just before reaching the top, my little arms pulling me up, the game glitched out and (apparently) sling-shotted me across town, and I found myself falling into the middle of the ocean! ""This isn't the roof!""
- Graphics Visuals
        - Not toooooo much to say. The visuals of the game, overall, were pretty solid, breathtaking at quite a few moments (gotcha!). My favorite visual element of the game is the eyes of characters. At times, they reflect so much emotion, and look so real!-- that is, when they aren't glitched out and disappear, leaving black voids between eye lids, making the character look like a demon. 

Cons:

- Driving
       - The driving in this game, to be honest, leaves quite a bit to be desired. Most of the vehicles drive slow-ish, have low top speeds, feel clunky, and have *huge* turning radii (for some reason). 

- Guns/Gunplay
       - While it's not the worst part of the game, by any means, it still feels a bit clunky at times, and I wish some of the effects of the guns got a bit more creative. Oftentimes, it's just a stat boost as you progress.

- Stats
       - The stats in this game are just plain old vague. When opening the Stats menu, the numbers reflected there are either not there or wrong, and the stats themselves are quite vague. The game doesn't explain what ""Armor"" even does for you-- no ratios, no explanations, no data, etc.. Of course, after looking it up, some players have found it gives you something like 1 projectile damage reduction per 40-50 armor, but that's all (nothing about melee, or other types of damages). Resistances are also vague, but oh well. Also, why the hell are explosions so insane? I can sit through turrets and a squad of 'Saka Elite Units for a bit, but a microwave exploding instakills? (Unsure of how much explosive resistance helps here, never gave it a try, but still annoying nonetheless). Could definitely use some attention here.

- Difficulty
       - The difficulty in this game is...weird, to say the least. I beat the game on Very Hard, but at times it was 1 of 2 things that happened: Either I randomly got killed in 2 hits, or I just went on a rampage (or crept through, all stealthy-like; depends on your build I guess, but I've read some similar experiences). It doesn't really feel ""Very Hard"" at times; just feels like you got gimped. Hard to experience the ""challenge"" of something when you just die in a couple of seconds. I would have liked to see some variations here, i.e., more effects to deal with, more health on enemies, or something else. 

- Glitches/Bugs
        - Of course, you expected to see this (so did I, don't worry!). Unfortunately, the game is PLAGUED by bugs and glitches, which often ruins the immersion of the setting/atmosphere and story. At times, they can be frustrating to deal with (like getting punched by the Animals Champion and literally not being able to get up, so you have to restore a save and try again). By no means can I justify or defend these glitches, but they had their ups and downs. 

- Side Quests/Gigs (Yep, again!)
    - Though I noted these as a Pro, they also have a downside, though it's more a system issue; kind of. The issue lies in the game's inability to distinguish between ""important"" side quests/gigs and random ones. In other words, there should be a different marker/category given to the Side Quests that have more bearing on the Main Story, or are particularly longer/more fleshed out and less simplistic, so that players don't miss out on them. (Like the vending machine one!) 
        - Side Note: The romance options are a bit limited, and I would like to see more options, and more attention to them. Unfortunately, the dialogue/route that these characters have are static, no matter if you can even romance them. For example: As a Male character, Judy seems to flirt with you at times, smiling and all, but then if you compliment her, she'll frown and say ""Bro, no"" ..... but then go back to smiling all sweet again. Mixed signals up the whazoo. And this can be seen at other moments, too, with other characters and options that don't seem to make sense/seem out of nowhere. 

- ""Open World"" Aspect
        - While I agree the game has quite a bit to be explored, there is a feel that the game isn't really as Open World as a player would expect (if they had that expectation at all). Instead, it's more of a guided RPG, with ""random"" events not actually being random, but scripted, limited, and the same for every player (i.e., all of those NCPD hustles/gigs and such). Although, this is only really a Con if you expected/wanted an Open World. 

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand that about concludes my thoughts on the game! (For now, at least!).",True
"Just like everything else reddit complains about, it's actually incredibly good",True
"If you have a good PC, then this game is actually pretty playable. I anticipate the bugs being fixed within a few months and content released, similar to NMS. Give this game a chance if you have the hardware, otherwise, hold off.",True
THERE IS NO ACHIeVEMENT FOR WATCHING ALL CREDITS.,True
Game of the year <3,True
"PROS:
- Amazing soundtrack
- Very good gameplay
- Incredible story 
- Memorable characters 
- Specifically: Jackie, Johnny, Panam & Judy.
- City is beautiful 
- Atmosphere
- Open world exploration
- The ending
- Overall combat
- Improvement systems and implants
- Overall: will play multiple times.

CONS:
- Bugs and glitches* But for me most of them where just visual bugs and not game breaking. I know other people have had worse bugs.
- Driving vehicles is absolutely terrible

*I think i'm going to stop playing until there are more patches. I want to play the best version of this game.",True
"Having just now completed the game 139 hours in, having finished every single side mission and misc open world activity in the entire game I can easily say that this game is absolutely worth it. Yes, it's not the single best game ever made but it is everything that a game in the Cyberpunk genre should be. 

The open world and side job activities can be lacking at times, though a lot of the storylines for different people (which count as side jobs) are extremely good. 

The main storyline is just outright amazing. If nothing else, I highly recommend playing the game if just for the story alone. Especially if you have any fears or doubts on death and immortality.",True
I only have about 30 hours played so far but I gotta say Im really enjoying the game. There are definitely a lot of issues and cut content but a lot of them can be fixed/added so Im not too worried. Even with all the problems I still think this game is really fun even though it was ruined by the higher ranks over at CDPR. Cant wait to see how this game will change over the next year.,True
"I can't deny that I have encountered several bugs during my playthrough but they haven't stopped me from the reaching the end of the game. Performance is not always brilliant and I think there is some kind of memory leak that make me restart the game after playing for more than 3 hours straight (with 16 GB of ram at that point it is pretty noticeable). The game is not the extremely deep RPG that was promised, is missing some content and some of the systems were clearly removed from the product to cut development time. NPC interaction is really simple, but it is enough to make me feel like the city is alive and breathing. There are some visual artifacts and glitches (objects floating in the air / clipping through the ground) but nothing too noticeable that will break the immersion.

Despite all of this, I've enjoyed every second that I've spent playing the game. The combat system is really close to what the Borderlands game are offering and this is a huge plus for me. The skill trees will let you decide the way you want to play the game without being too strict and the cyberware customization is amazing, hopefully they'll add more components in future updates. If you love collecting weapons, cars and rare pieces of clothing you'll have a good time playing this game (many hours!).

The story is amazing (maybe a bit rushed in the prologue) and the secondary missions are extremely well written and interesting, and I'd go as far as saying that they are as interesting as the main story and at times even more. The characters are simply impressive, some of them are extremely detailed and the way they act with subtle facial expressions and movements is breaking the wall between the player and the game in a way i've never experienced before. After finishing the game I can say that I feel sad for not being able to interact with them anymore, they've left a void that I don't think any other game will be able to fill in the near future.",True
"Everyone talks about the bugs and glitches, but those aren't the main reasons to stay away from this game:

It fails as a shooter; the combat is boring and clunky and feels like a chore most of the time
It fails as an RPG: There is little to no customization for anything in this game. There aren't any cool cybernetics that make the game interesting, most of them are just upgrades to the generic stats you find in every other game. (Apart from mantis blades, those are awesome, for the first 10 minutes). 
The charaters and story would be fine if the rest of the game was enjoyable, but they definitely aren't good enough to carry the game in its current state.
The ""open"" world is more empty and bland than anything Ubisoft could ever hope to achieve. There is nothing interesting going on outside of missions and the occasional clashes.
The AI is the dumbest I've seen in any recent game, to a point where any interaction with an NPC in this game breaks the immersion.
Physics for driving and objects are fine, but nothing special.

I'm confident that CDPR will fix most of the major bugs and glitches in the coming months, but that's not really what's wrong here; this game is bad to the core. Most of the real issues are things that can't be fixed, or won't be fixed because it would take too much time and resources.

So in conclusion: don't buy this. Maybe buy it and refund after 2 hours to look at some pretty setpieces if your PC can handle it, but that's it.",False
"[h3]Cyberpunk 2077[/h3]

was one of the most anticipated Games of the Year 2020, and even long before that delayed Launch-Date. From the Producers of the amazing RPG called The Witcher, this Game gives you the opportunity to explore a big Sci-Fi City called Night City.

As Player you take control of the Protagonist with the Nickname V to become one of the most famous Mercenaries in Night City, cause eather you live a long live and be a Nobody or you die at a young age in a way to be remembered. And to reach that goal you need good friends on your side.
In First-Person Action-Shooter Style you will be lead through a lot of story driven and nice designed sceneries. How you deal with some situations is up to you and only limited by the Skill-Trees that are offered to the Player.

The Games best Part is definitely the Part where you explore the Storylines of Side-Characters and where you see what they have to deal with. What kind of people they are and how you can interact with them.
The Main-Story itself comes as the second good thing in Cyberpunk, but sadly was a little bit too short.

The rest of the Game is, even more sadly, very boring. The City feels sorta empty. Like a too big world got developed first and the Gameplay never implemented. And so the most of the Time, besides from the two good Parts of the Game, Players just have to run around to farm experience Points and the Ingame-Currency from very monotonic and boring tasks like (take out bad guys here, hack into a PC there).
With other Words: the Game world is far too big and the amount of interesting story driven Quests is too short. So it feels a little bit underdeveloped (not to mention some Bugs that appeared right after release).

Still I recommend this Game to every Person that likes First-Person Action Shooters that are driven by Sci-Fi-Story-Elements. (And lets hope that CD Project Red will bring more *actual* Content into the Game in Future days)

---------------------------------
[h3]The Points i give this Game: (Average 5,8 / 10)[/h3]
7,8 / 10 Grafics (nice Details in the Gameworld but almost without an actual meaning to it *like a Candy you are just allowed to look at but not to eat*)
4,5 / 10 Gameplay (Its like many other First-Person Shooters and has nothing unique about Gameplay, even Hacking is just looking at enemies and pressing on a few Numbers)
6 / 10 Soundtrack (There are some, but none of them are really memorable)
6,4 / 10 Main-Story (Nice made, but far too short for that big kind of Game and the Plot at the End felt lazy written)
8,5 / 10 Side-Story (Best Part of the Game, but not enough of it to really fill the empty Gameworld)
9 / 10 Characters (Interesting Characters that hopefully get more attention and more company in Future Content-Updates)
3 / 10 Enemies (Enemies are boring and have not enough scripts to react properly to the Players / too easy to beat *even on very Hard Mode*)
1 / 10 Bossfights (Boss-Encounters are the worst Part of the Game, weren’t even a challenge cause of the *restart-Quickhack* and the Bots hard limitations to properly react to Players Actions / They are down after one of those Quickhacks even on very Hard Mode)

---------------------------------
[h3]What i think is a good Price:[/h3]
The Game-World is surely big, but the Content is just not enough, therefore I would say that a good Price for this would be 25 € or less. (most of the Money payed for just good graphics).",True
"Oh man.
This game is the GOTY and the most disappointment game of the year at the same time. I experienced many, many bugs but surprised that I didn't have any crashes. The game runs on 1070ti like totally disaster in some places like Japan town or China town, played on the lowest settings but still looks decent. Did everything 100% on Very Hard, the main story is short, and not that shocking (the beginning was really good while doing mission in ""All Food"" plant with Jackie). The gun play is really fun, but the worst thing in this game in my opinion was the brawling, especially brawling missions, what a horrible designed fights when you have to punch a guy 1000 times to win and dodge everything (because you get 1-2 hits and you die lol). I don't know, music is good, great characters except V is annoying af, a very, VERY small selection of character customization, very disappointment (even in Nioh 2 there is a bigger character customization).  All in all this game is definitely feels unfinished with the lack of content and bugs and its doesn't feel very interesting like they did advertise the game, for me it didn't have ""WOW"" or ""SHOCKED"" moments, it feels like another, typical, fps open world game.
7/10",True
"  How to begin? Everything that I will say about this game will be separated completely from all the hate given by a certain demographic of people (last gen console users mostly but there are others as well) who, since they couldn't play the game, or it didn't lived to their expectations (sci-fi GTA, hurr durr) or it didn't surrender to cater to a well known political agenda (SJWs, the lot of you, little shits), decided that it was best to trash the game itself out of a storm of fury that I never saw in other triple A RPG releases.

  First of all, I have always had a personal preference for anything related to the Cyberpunk genre, the whole thing about humans, machines and the AIs, the conflict with transhumanism and all the philosophical topics going around our very own soul: ""What's makes us different, what makes us human?"".

  [i] Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Gunnm [/i] (also known in the West as Battle Angel Alita), the whole universe of 
 [i] Deus Ex [/i] , and so on, I could keep bringing more examples of a genre that was important in the past but it ended up as a niche sort of thing in these times. Cyberpunk 2077 brought the light back into it, made quite some people (even friends of mine) into getting deeper into the genre, listening to synthwave/retromusic and getting a knack on the whole aesthetics that comes with the whole thing.

  This game was truly a blast, from the very starting point to the end, and the whole experience could be resumed into a few words said by a known streamer who also got a kink for this stuff (Dr. Disrespect). When asked about he thought about the upcoming release of CP2077, he said something in the lines of: ""CP? it's not going to be a game, it's going to be a journey"".

  And that's it, folks. A journey. One through all the negative facts of an uncontrolled corporate capitalism, when corps take control of everything and make believe that you are free, while in reality, you are not, just a mere slave in the whole production chain of the never ending pursuit of power and greed. 

  Also, throughout the whole deal about transhumanism, the need to keep enhancing our bodies to the point of almost breaking the thin line that keeps us from being humans and the desire to inmortalize ourselves, to become something nearby of a God.

  I could continue writing about it (doing this review after taking my sweet time into playing, completing everything in the whole map and finishing the story) but I'm afraid I would tire you at some point so let's go to the pros and cons about this game instead.

PROS
  + The map and the whole city, just fantastic. I have no words for the level of detail that you can see on everything, you can tell they took their time into adding even the smallest shit to make Night City believable.

  + The music, totally at tune with the whole setting, specially the rock radio station, ha! Ended up in more of a car crash just because of banging my head to the tunes.

  + The story. Fucking amazing, felt like a whole movie and the characters felt alive as well, I did sensed a strong bind with quite many of them, and that's like one of the main big points in my book for a game to be great: how well written the story is.

  + The combat system, addicting as fuck, always looked for an excuse to fight in the streets, even roleplaying as a cop to purge the streets of the criminal scum around.

  + Armors/Vehicles, it was decent for me, lots of items to always have a different outfit, and the amount of vehicles at your disposal was also good enough (you can also steal vehicles from the street as well). The interior of the vehicles, also a beautiful touch, making each one unique.

CONS
  + If you try to parkour a bit at the city, you can notice parts of the map that had being left there in such a hurry, specially what it seemed like a whole full train system that you would be able to use to get yourself around the City (like what we saw in one of the early game trailers). Better be aware tho of not falling through the map and getting into the infinite abyss.

  + Certain dialogues/ pressing keys in a certain way/ trying to reach places that you shouldn't get there would cause bugs (but you can always just create a manual save and reload it again to refresh the game and get rid of those). 

  + The driving system needs more polishing, I know, it's not GTA, I don't care about it because I was looking for an rpg experience, but the whole physics thing needs more work, specially while driving bikes and taking turns with them.

  + The game is crying for even more customization options, you can't edit your characters looks after you create them, there are no sorts of barbershops in the city for that, which is a shame. Also about the cyberware options, while I get the meaning of limiting what you can install in your body as V, but seriously, why we can't be full cyborgs if we want to do that? Even more, make cyberpsychosis a real thing that can affect V, depending on the amount of cybermodifications that we have, stuff that can even pushes ourselves into getting even another ending, if we wanted to do the whole cyborg path.

  + The amount of secondary stuff that you can do in the game is acceptable but, since there are no radiant type of quests like we are used to see from Bethesda's games or even Ubisoft's, once you end up doing everything, there's nothing else to accomplish than to finish the main story. CDPR should seriously consider adding more stuff into that, expanding what you can do in clubs, adding other kinds of activities to do, even they could add a whole radiant faction system so you could work along with any of the gangs that are roaming at Night City, getting benefits and downsides by working with one gang over the rest. Oh, you could also add the police force as well to the equation, or even the corps like Militech and Arasaka, the options are endless.

+  I didn't experienced much of the amount of weird ass bugs that people were reporting or even transforming into memes, but I did saw at least a few, nothing terrible and non game breaking tho, but something that CDPR should fix.


Veredict: A 9 out of 10, but, since I do trust the polish guys at CDPR to fix and expand the game even more, like they did with The Witcher 3 in its time, gonna give it a solid 10/10. It was why I was expecting (even with the cons mentioned before), glad I did survived this whole shitty COVID situation until this point to be able to play this great game.

"Do you like SAMURAI? Their early work was a little too grunge for my tastes, but when Blistering Love came out in '05, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. Johnny's been compared to Kerry Eurodyne, but I think Johnny has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor. In '20, SAMURAI released this, A Cool Metal Fire, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is ""A Like Supreme"", a song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the dangers of corporate colonialism, and the importance of fighting tyranny, it's also a personal statement about the band itself.",True
"Despite it's poor optimisation with the glitches and faults like the physics, Cyberpunk 2077 is an amazing concept and it did turn out to be an amazing game - faults aside. The graphics are immersive, gameplay was fun for me with the mechanics and missions, story was great with the plot, characters but I do recommend completing the side missions to get the full story of what the game has to offer!

"Despite all the bugs and messed up optimization, the game is absolutely *breathtaking*, awesome, and massive. Its the first singleplayer game in long long years where I just sank into, and barely even noticed when 50 hours passed by.

Thx to CD Project Red for their existence.,True
"First I’d like to mention that on the days coming up to the release of the game I knew this wasn’t going to be a usual launch. I was prepared for the game to have some defects considering the delays and mystery around CDPR. I also don’t think the company should be excused for their console treatment. With that said I’m just here to give an opinion on the game itself and tell you if you should buy it or not.

After completing the main story and most of the side quests I can confidently say the game provides a solid experience. In terms of gameplay I found it fun to go around taking down gang members, corps, and cyberpsychos. The stories told through the side quests and main questline were mostly intriguing, definitely on par with the questlines in TW3. Where the game really shines for me is the world building. It is evident that the source material for the game was carefully implemented in this game and took a lot of time to construct. Night City and its ambiance feel like a complete character on its own. Speaking of characters, I thought the main characters you interact with were well written and believable.

However, there were aspects of the game that disappointed me. Overall I feel like that the game was a little empty. A lot of times while playing the game I thought to myself “Damn, it would’ve been nice if they added such and such or this or that”. The enemy AI was also kind of lacking a bit. Some of the side quests got a little repetitive in theme too and I wish there was a little more of a variety. While I said the world building was done well there wasn’t a whole lot of opportunities to interact with it and feel really immersed. Lastly, I had minimal bugs while playing the game, nothing crazy like Bethesda games. What did bother me was the lack of optimization, at least once every session I would have to restart the game because my game took a dip in fps.

The game is good, not amazing or great. It has some faults and it has some great moments. I don’t regret buying the game and I plan on playing through it again if they add substantial features to it. I wouldn’t suggest buying the game full price unless they improve it in some way, but it will definitely be worth it when it goes on sale.

"Spoiler free review
For preface, my specs are Ryzen 7 2700, RTX 2080, and running this game at 2k (1440p)
I run the game on High and get an average of 45ish frames.
I have exhausted all options to optimize this game but nothing really works. 
 
First of all, the game's story is phenomenal. CDPR does a remarkable job crafting compelling stories that make you fall in love with the characters that you’re around, or the one that’s stuck in your head. Keanu’s performance in this game is... I will say good. The reason is, is that his acting seems almost subpar when Johnny is supposed to be angry. It’s not convincing or doesn’t sit right with me, watching other characters get angry in a convincing manner (like Panam yelling for example). His performance when casually talking or boasting is more than enough to love CDPR for choosing Keanu and commemorate him for this amazing performance. Each main character's compelling story made me fall in love with all of them, made me want to help and is the main reason that I am writing this review in the first place. My only complaint about each character side stories is that after romancing a character and spending all this time with them. Helping them out with everything, they kinda just fall off the face of the earth and don't contact you again. I personally would like something more, but I think optimization of the game should come first.

Second the gameplay
Combat in this game could use a bit of an improvement. At first the game is really slow and not very rewarding. Gunplay in the beginning of the game is something that is less than desired. But on the other hand, the progression in the game is outstanding, final builds allow you to one shot opponents. It's practically getting there and suffering in the beginning is the only problem with combat. 

The open world of the game is something that could use a bit of an overhaul or more time in the oven. AI is more unintelligent than intelligent (random civilians) and their robot-like behavior, there are a plethora of youtube videos talking about them. Combat AI is really good, they are there to do one thing and almost one thing only, and they do it really well. The combat system punishes you for playing poorly, running around recklessly and not using cover, but this does not discourage melee builds, there are many perks to counteract and actually have advantages in these reckless scenarios. 

The customization in the game is almost comical. At first glance of the customization you can apply the most hideous and heinous combinations of clothing that makes your character look something that is… less than desired. All because those horrible clothes have the best stats. Character customization is really something else. It's fairly in depth and you could spend an hour or two just creating your perfect V. One major downside to character customization is that after creating your V and going into Night City, you cannot change your character's appearance. Another weird downside, if you are of male or female body type, if you have the opposite junk, whether it be a wifi antenna or usb port, it won’t change anything. It brings the question “why add this in the first place if this changes nothing”. 

Now on to my favorite part, THE BUGS. There are quite an amount of bugs in this game. The bugs in this game are nothing to be too scared of on PC. With the new patch, I believe it’s hotfix 1.05[?] they fixed the corrupt save files. But nothing in this game has bugs that are game braking. More of laughter or confusion than anger. The game has never crashed on me, but the game did soft lock on me a few times in my play through causing me to simply die or not move until I reloaded my closest save (auto save really saved me). Sometimes I just had to simply press escape to bring up the menu and that would usually fix it. There is one instance where I actually cannot continue a quest, I will say it's a very minor quest, but I have no idea how I broke it, and it’s a little sad to not be able to continue it. But a sizable chunk of the games’ bugs can be ironed out in the coming months if CDPR stays afloat. 


The devs did a phenomenal job in crafting a world that’s really easy to get lost in. The only real complaint that I have is that this game could have been delayed another 3-4 months and it would have been one of, if not the best game in modern time.

TL:DR:  Pros
- Characters are amazing
- Combat good late game
- Story is spectacular 
- It has Keanu Reeves 
- Panam Palmer
- Skippy

Cons
- Customization is lacking
- Open world civilians are kinda dumb
- Slow start
- Bugs

"Not gonna waste my words on bugs/glitches, god awful combat mechanics or how unpolished the game is. The entire gaming community knows about it by now. So I will focus on something far more important. The lack of content. 
Night city is an amazing place. The vibrancy, the ""noise"", the people and bots, everything is intriguing and exciting to an extent. I cant even begin to wonder the amount of effort, thought and imagination went into making night city. The attention to detail, as is expected from CDPR. Despite achieving this, night city quickly becomes rather dull and boring. It lacks something important. After a while, no matter where you go the map, it's the same ""steal this, shoot that"" gameplay thrown at us. Not that any other game isn't repetitive but the combat mechanics in this game made the repetition, bit boring. Cyberpsycho sightings was also something that could have been an interesting line to follow but quickly turns into just another ""task"" thrown at us. With this game, the idea, the concept was a bit too ambitious and the serious lack of content or ""stories"" or ""life"" makes the game boring real soon. 

So to sum up, in its current state, I definitely won't recommend this game but I will be following its future releases just to be able to change my review.",False

"70H and that my first run , i love this game so much the story is breathtaking the city is great and the characters are the best thing in the whole game , the game is easily gets in my top 10 best games of all time",True
"Look, I know it has it's flaws, quite a few even. But damn, at it's core, this game is a masterpiece. I'm obviously speaking for the PC version. But the narrative is excellent, with deep and meaningful characters. The diverging paths are interesting and leave you often with difficult decisions. 

Honestly, haven't had a game grab me quite like this one in a while.",True
"I have greatly enjoyed the game so far, and with CDPRs commitment to it, it will get more polished, bugs squashed, and further DLC (hopefully free!). 

Highly recommend the game. beautiful eye candy for graphics, a great story, great music and voice acting. Multiple ways to build your character, be warned your choices are semi permanent! 

 Minor visual bugs and odd roadblock of a bug can prevent quest completion (reload a save if you think it is bugging!) I have had nothing game breaking so far in my first playthru, and nothing yet during my 2nd. The data corruption bug has already been patched out. 

Only thing I feel bad is for the console players who are having a rough go with the game, and can't enjoy it.",True

Even in its current state, it's still a game that I had tons of fun with, if my achievement hunting and 100 hours weren't proof already. That being said, have no illusions, this game is not a life-sim, there will be moments where the wizard is revealed from behind the curtain and all that jazz. Still, tons of fun, a lot of the bugs are a laugh too.

P.S. give the prophet a hundred eddies :)",True
"You need to get at least 12 hours of game time in before you can really say that you are playing the game.  The city is vast and beautiful, the stories are fantastic, and the replayability is pretty significant. This game is amazing despite the bugs and irl drama. The actual game feels a lot more like Oblivion than Skyrim and I intend that as a compliment.",True
"The game has a lot of bugs. Like a lot. Some missions are broken and unplayable, cars spawn in and out of existence seemingly at will, falling from a heigh of about 2 feet will kill you instantly. Enemies are incredibly spongey, and sometimes just 1 shot you or make impossible shots, or see you behind objects. 

But panam got a FAT ass so that makes up for it.",True
"En general el juego está muy bien y me lo he pasado genial, que al final es lo que cuenta. Futuro distópico, ciudad cautivadora y unos personajes y unas historias muy por encima de lo que estamos (o estoy) acostumbrados.

Elegí el camino del CORPO, así que me tomé el juego por el lado del sigilo, aunque tienes que tirar de fusco si o si en muchas misiones. Al final del juego y con armas de meleé también me lo pasé muy bien. El sistema de habilidades no te deja mucho margen para no especializarte y es difícil ser un “Jack of all Trades”, ya que te quedas corto en todas si intentas ir equilibrando.

En 69 horas he acabado la historia principal y un porrón de Side Jobs y Gigs. Como dije antes, casi todas esas historias están muy chulas. Si usas es quickhacking y el sigilo el juego es muy satisfactorio. He hecho side jobs y gigs que me han recordado al Hitman. 

Eso sí, el juego no es innovador en ningún aspecto. Todas las mecánicas que hay ya las he visto antes en un juego u otro. Nada nuevo. Como RPG, pues evolucionas a V, pero en realidad V tiene su personalidad y tus decisiones afectan poco (mas allá de los diferentes finales). Los NPC están vacíos y no interactúan contigo de ninguna manera. Son parte del escenario.

Yo no he tenido ningún bug de los que te rompen el juego y/o el progreso. Tiene mucho glitch (nada nuevo en CD Project con los tres witchers que he jugado de salida)
Muchísimos de los pequeños problemas se pueden arreglar (e imagino que a base de parches el juego dentro de un año merecerá la pena volver a jugarlo, y al que no lo haya comprado todavía, pillarlo a precio de ganga)

Tiene cosas que sacan un poco de quicio. Las dos actividades de las carreras y los combates de boxeo rozan lo patético. No sé quién dio luz verde a que estuviesen incluidas en el juego final, pero se cubrió de gloria. Las mecánicas son absurdas y muy mal hechas. Las historias que traen asociadas, las peores. En general la conducción está muy mal hecha, lo que hace que uses viaje rápido e incluso andar antes que usar los vehículos disponibles. El combate cuerpo a cuerpo también deja bastante que desear. Mejora con espadas y bates, pero a puñetazos da penica. 

El sistema de crimen y castigo es muy limitado y cutre. El sistema de mejoras no merece la pena ya que la cantidad de loot que recibes es inmensa, y siempre hay un arma o un ítem mejor que lo que tenías. Al final solo vale para craftear mods para las armas y la ropa. 

En resumen, el juego tiene algunos problemas, pero está muy bien, y lo bueno contrarresta por mucho a lo malo.

Seriously tho. This game is overhyped+underdelivered, unfinished, raw, and many other negative things. But what it also is, is fun. Fun, is all a game has to be to enjoy it.
Despite all the issues it still manages to make me wanna come back for more. And i really hope CDPR improves it over the weeks, months and years for everyone to enjoy, as much as i do, even now.

"The highly anticipated game of the decade fell victim to incredibly high expectations and poor management of CD Projekt RED company

Night City is the most beautiful open world in the industry full of content that can be compared with Los Santos from GTA V by its size

Narratively powerful and emotionally immersive story with impressive performance and different huge and powerful endings. The plot can be supplemented with additional solutions and huge high-quality side quest lines 

Cyberpunk 2077 is largely linear in its plot, but offers many options for resolving situations, especially in the ending

The game completely erases the line between good and evil. Cyberpunk 2077 tells us about death and attitude towards it, as well as about the personality and its facets. In small things, the game will cruelly and beautifully ridicule the mistakes and vices of modern people

Therefore, the plot of Cyberpunk can be called the most complex and the most adult of all CDPR games

Unlike The Witcher 3, you build your own past, nature, and destiny as V, a character you create. Your decisions also determine the fate of many things and characters in this story. Keanu Reeves' Johnny Silverhand will become one of the most iconic characters in video games

The game has interesting and variable action with good RPG progression systems which affect the range of options in all game aspects

The world of the game looks incredibly beautiful and lively in the places of the main plot and some sudden side quests. But as a whole, the city serves as a quality, but somewhat lifeless decoration.

I can also admit that the additional content scattered around the map are just OK, and you can get your fill of fun doing them

Poor car control and lack of theirs customization, static AI behavior in the city is not a tragedy, but I expected much more from such a game in that aspects

In my opinion soundtrack is good and stylish but not impressive after Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt 

CD Projekt RED, especially their management, have tried to jump far beyond their capabilities
Last time, such aspirations gave us the monumental masterpiece ""Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt""

But Cyberpunk 2077 is just a great game that needs time to polish and improve with upcoming updates and big DLCs",True
"Let me just start by saying that if you like this game - you've won the argument by virtue of enjoying something I'm struggling to. If you're having fun, that's great. If you're besotted with the world, that's fair, and you're not wrong. Nothing in this review is intended to piss off the hive. I just have to write about the impressions I honestly feel.

Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that is unforgivably marred by one thing and one thing only - overpromotion. A thesis could be written on how audacious Cyberpunk's marketing has been. The hype train is, of course, not all CDPR's fault, but the false promises are. Releasing too early and expecting you to pay £50 for the privilege of being an unofficial beta tester is. Look, I work in marketing, so I know how it goes. But when you promise so much and know you can't deliver on it, and change your marketing material in order to refer to the game as an 'action-adventure' rather than an 'RPG' before release - well, it doesn't sit right with me. If Ubisoft had done this, I would have blown my top. I have to stay consistent.

Let me make this clear - I was not on the hype train for this game. Hype makes me feel nervous, and I try to deaden myself to it. I'm also realistic. I understood that it takes more for a game to be developed in the current-gen to offer a truly next-generation experience, and found it a miracle that Red Dead Redemption 2, by contrast, was so incredibly detailed and complex, if less dense than this title. I'm also not a stickler for bugs. I know they'll get patched and fixed, and that performance will improve. 

What I did expect, however, is what was promised. In this game, there is no advanced vehicle AI, which means police chases simply cannot happen. That's a system that was present in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. NPC's are lifeless, and are barely worth interacting with. The world has strong art direction and can look quite beautiful at times, but it's far from 'breathing,' and routinely feels shallow and tired thanks to how repetitive and basic the NPC and traffic routines are. It reminds me of a Mafia game, where the open world is just set dressing, serving effectively as a long loading screen as you move from place to place. But this isn't how the game was marketed. From the offset, they outright promised a sandbox RPG featuring incredibly dense and novel NPC interactions and narrative paths. I didn't buy into everything they said of course, but when your world is even less impressive than the last Watch Dogs game, I have to wonder what's going on.

The gunplay is punchy despite the inconsistent ballistics, the upgrade tree is relatively cool (if deceptively limited), and the moment-to-moment gameplay is all just... serviceable? It's not an RPG I find to be particularly deep. This is a somewhat moot point - but there's little gameplay here you haven't already seen achieved more competently in titles like Sleeping Dogs, Deus Ex and Fallout. Driving feels dated, as if the vehicles have no substantial momentum to them. It's the little details that are truly noticeable, like V not even sleeping correctly in his bed, or QoL considerations, like the lack of a dedicated walk button on keyboard, that culminates in making the game feel average at best. I have no idea what happened with the life paths. I was led to believe they would be as long and impactful as the origin stories in Dragon Age: Origins, but they're just 20-minute starter sequences geared to introduce you to the world at breakneck speed. They feel like cut content.

The good stuff here involves both the reliably impressive writing and story sequences. Yet thanks to the limited input you have for role-playing, it regularly feels like you're watching a (very cool) television show. It's nowhere near as reactive and dynamic I had hoped, not even half as much as The Witcher 2. If this game only featured its story front and centre, I would have given this a positive review. However, it doesn't, and I can't give a thumbs up for undercooked ambition or good writing when it's less than 25% of the experience, especially with all this mediocre fluff surrounding it. I say that even as someone who is willing to tolerate much for a good story. The amazing sequences you see are, ironically, those that would make for the best trailer-bait, and oh boy, did they.

Cyberpunk's writing is far from perfect though, especially in its presentation and pacing. I'm never provided the means to care about V at all. Thanks to his introductory montage, you're given relationships, professional contacts and a criminal reputation in the space of around two minutes. It's hard to get your bearings. Compare this to Kingdom Come: Deliverance, where the horrific origins of Henry's developing heroism are fully-playable, rooted, grounded in your humble status. It helps you build your own relationship to his ambition - ambition that stays with you throughout the game. There's nothing like that here.

A side note - it's very easy to assume that it's the fault of those who are heavily involved in watching the press cycle for getting their own hopes up, buying into every op-ed and/or preview carefully curated to generate clicks and escalating excitement for the game. Unfortunately, you would also have to be blind to the design patterns and trends of the last ten years to not see how derivative the vast majority of Cyberpunk's systems are. It's not a bad thing to be derivative, not always, but if you've marketed your game as being anything but that from day one, well, people are going to notice.

I have no doubt this game will improve in the next year, in terms of its optimisation, performance, bug-squashing and maybe even additional content. For now, I would advise on-the-fence newcomers to steer well clear. I would also recommend that you stay sceptical of people who want to lambast absolutely everything in this game, as well as those who somehow think critical impressions are misguided at best or hate at worst. Certain elements of this game have been crafted with noticeable care and heartfelt attention to detail, such as the side quests, which can show real glimpses of brilliance. I imagine a few of the actual developers want to strangle the marketing and management teams right now - and trust me, I get it.

I would have likely brushed this off as a fine, sometimes above-average game, ignoring the bugs and lack of innovative features as simply par for the course. I may have given it a positive review if it were honestly janky, but feature-complete, closer to the promises we were given. What I can't do is positively review a product sold under wilfully and repeatedly false pretences. That's weird for me because I don't usually take a principled stand, if you can label a cringe review as that. I didn't much care about Epic strong-arming their way into the market, for instance. I'm not entirely sure how much of this ad campaign was straight deception on CDPR's part, and how much of it was comprised of well-wishing narratives that exploded out of control, magnified by the sacred reputation gamers had anointed them with, all while they found their feet in a new and strange genre. 

For whatever reason, this time it feels odious. Maybe I'm just getting old.",False

"[h1] No Spoiler detailed review! [/h1]

[b]Story - 11\10[/b] - Absolutely incredible, emotional journey.
 
Main Quests - 20-30~ hours \ Incredible gameplay, missions and production. 
Side Quests - 30~ hours \ Amazing stories, some weird some emotional and some for the laughs. 
GIGS - 50~ hours \ They are there if you want to clean the city up and enjoy the combat. Most had a focus on core gameplay loop. Which depending on how you play or what you enjoy, will ether like it or think its filler. Its there if you really want to get rich, Buy all the cars and level up your character and weapons. 

Thoughts on choices and connected world. You have to sacrifice some choice in design to build a story like this. Or you will just get a brush over ending with some dialog and text. 

I completed every single Side mission, gig and mainquest on the map and it took me exactly 100 hours. I did my share of exploring and using the photomode for about 1.5 hours) There is more to do after you beat the game as well, but I am writing this review before exploring these options and before doing the other endings the game has to offer. I assume they will release a New Game Plus in the future, similar to Witcher 3. I did everything before the point of the no return on my first run on Very Hard Difficulty. Wish the game was a bit more challenging, maybe it was a result of how I played but even on Very Hard, it was a cake walk for me. I will update my review if needed once I complete the other endings and content. 

[b]Music - 11\10[/b] - Perfect choice of music at key moments, combat music always kicked into gear perfectly. Music is a huge part of the game. 
[b]Art Direction - 11\10[/b] - Everything was designed with purpose. The level of detail in characters even minor ones, clothes, tattoos, the city, colors, cars. Nothing felt out of place. 

[b]Graphics - 11\10[/b] - Absolutely insane especially on High\Ultra.
[b]Performance - 9.5\10[/b] - Not one crash for my entire 100+ hours. Solid 30-45fps on High\Medium settings. No Stuttering and exceptionally smooth. I have played many single player games with 30-45 fps and it didn’t feel nearly as smooth as this. I alt tab out of the games a lot also, no memory leaks, never did it get stuck and was always able to alt tab back in immediately. First load and save loads where almost instant on a SSD.
[b]Bugs - 7\10[/b] - Mostly visual bugs, The weird T pose here and there, driving into people and cars when a NPC was driving. A inventory bug where I could not remove some iconics, One GIG: Sidequest bug that required me to find a body that was not where it was supposed to be. One Mainquest bug that required me to load a autosave 3 mins before the bug happened. Yes the graphical bugs did happen a bit to often, but nothing gamebreaking, definitely took me out of the immersion a few times tho. 

[b]Gameplay - 8\10[/b] - All together the gameplay was fun but a few missed opportunities for sure, the boss enemies for sure left me with more to be desired. 

[b]Gunplay - 8\10[/b] - Felt good, The shooting was fun and if you played like me Neo Matrix style you could really get creative with the combos. Just wish they had a few more unique Iconic weapons. The system for something amazing is there, just needs to be worked out and built upon. 
[b]Melee - n\a[/b] - The only melee I did was the boxing, I put nothing into brawler or blades. Boxing felt as I would expect tho, Punches felt like they do in every fps game I have played with melee. I wont rate it because I really didn’t try any of those features.
[b]Hacking - 8\10[/b]  - Almost anything can be hacked, super fun to use in combination with the gunplay, Just wish the enemies had more counters to you. I would say its a bit overpowered but everything is overpowered in the game. You become a god way to fast.
[b]Driving - 8\10[/b] - Besides not being able to break haha, It was good. Cheap cars felt bad good cars and bikes felt great. The drifting was super fun. But this isn’t a racing game, it did its job. 
[b]Leveling System - 9\10[/b] - I really like how level progression works. Leveling many aspects depending on what you use most, and many layers. Not just one set of points that controls everything. 
[b]Cyberware - 7\10[/b] - Definitely expected a bit more here. The system for greatness is there, it just felt like a missed opportunity with the abilities and mods. I expect them to build on this as well. 

[b]Final thoughts[/b]

This is more of a action RPG rather a sim. But I liked that. Ya I wish I could customize my cars and character a bit more. Get more creative with how I look but these are minor things at least for me. About the only thing I really hoped for was being able to customize and grow my apartment in the game. Place Iconic weapons and items in places I want them displayed. Something to visually show my journey. The wanted system 100% needs to be improved. There are definitely unfinished gameplay elements as well, crafting does its job if you want to max out weapons but is not deep. Trauma Team was a huge, missed opportunity. You can tell they needed an extra 6-12 months, and they should not have released this game on old generation consoles. If they focused on PC + Next Gen a lot of these issues would have been avoidable. Long term sales greater than short term sales and massive backlash was not worth whatever reason the execs thought to do this. It is truly a shame what happened to this game at launch. What the team did with story, world building and music is truly masterclass. I honestly believe if the team survives what is going on now this game will be near perfect in a year. At least I hope so. If the DLC and expansions are anything like Witcher 3 we are only in for more greatness. Really hope CDPR grows from this and does not lose key talent. It would truly be a tragedy in gaming.

Update: Just finished 6\7 of the endings and wow, I did not expect so much to be different between some of the major endings. Changed the hours on playthrough to reflect this. I am going to be thinking about this game for a while. Truly incredible experience! 

Added notes: Think of this game like as a open world Deus Ex with some RPG elements and you will not be disappointed. Especially if you enjoy narrative focused gaming.

Pros:
- Beautiful world

Night City is the main character of this game. It's a huge world, and almost all of it looks good. Raytracing makes this game look astonishingly delicious looking, especially at night.

- Great Story
- Great Characters

It's a compelling and interesting story. I was expecting a kickass story about killing corpos and flipping it to the man, but instead I got a very melancholic, human story. The universe of night city is insane, and everything is wrong with the dystopian world that V lives in, but the people are still humans filled with emotions, wants, needs, fears, and loves. There's an underlying sadness to the stories of night city, of struggling and survival, and the interactions really sell this.

The choice to use first person camera is what sells these interactions. You're right up in their faces, and you really feel for the characters. When the game just sits you on a cliffside with a character, you really feel like you're having a heart to heart.

The main story is relatively short, and gives you the freedom to come back to it at any time. When you finish the game, you'll be plonked right back before the point of no return, so you can go to some side missions. The characters you meet and talk with throughout the game can affect the ending of the game, and it does so in a really nice, cohesive way that rewards your interactions, and doesn't feel obvious that you ticked the right box.

Keanu is also a great addition to the game. While his delivery can be flat at times, his character as Johnny Silverhand is a great one, and the relationship between him and V is an interesting and engaging one. It's also a great narrative device, allowing V to have a conversation to himself without V literally talking to themselves.

- Good use of unique skills

Kinda like the newer Deus Ex games, each mission has a variety of ways to finish the mission. You can make a build, and in most cases the level design accommodates for that style of gameplay. Want to do a stealth approach? There's a window at the back you can jimmy open. Want to talk your way through? Try your luck talking to the receptionist, you might be able to pose as a repair man. Or you could just kick the door down and start taking names.

- Good Side Content

While overwhelming at first, once you shift through the information overload, the side missions are great. Each side gig is unique enough that you can choose different approaches to any situation.

Semi Spoilers: The side gigs also can affect the ending of the game, and give you more options on how to approach a situation if you've played the game. This is real rewarding.

- Great Voice Acting

Every character is voiced excellently (barring some cameos I'll mention later). Both male and female V are great and I had no issues with either, though a lot of people say they prefer femV, so maybe its a preference thing. It's certainly no MaleShep situation. In combination with the good characters, you're really invested in the people you talk to.

- Good gunplay

All the guns are real satisfying to use. There's a decent variety of weapons to choose from to suit your play style. If you struggle with fine tuned aiming, you can get smart weapons that do the aiming for you, so you can spec into guns without the fine control.

Cons:
- Performance

Running a 3080, I thought I'd get more frames running at 1080p, however without DLSS I was max 65fps with constant dips into 40. I anticipate a that will get better, but if you want a smooth experience, use DLSS if you can do so. I also had to overclock my CPU to get some performance out of this game, as the base 3.6 clock wasn't working for me.

- Bugs. 

I expect these will be fixed in the coming months post-release. For the most part, nothing serious, things like t-posing, physics glitches, etc. The only serious bug I found was an issue with a side gig that won't activate for me, leaving me unable to finish the district. There was enough bugs for immersion being broken at a semi-regular interval, which is especially jarring in intense emotional scenes being disturbed by a car being physics'ed into a wall behind you, or an item appearing in someones head.

- No mini game or roleplay events

A large open world with not much to do in it. If you're looking for activities to do for downtime and roleplay, there isn't anything there. No minigames, or playing pool, sitting at a bar. You can only do the map events. Purchasing things from a vendor simply involved a store menu and nothing else, which is jarring when the vendor goes ""have a drink on me"" and they just throw you to the same shop menu to purchase the same stuff you've been looting already.

- Melee combat is only ok

In contrast with the good gunplay, melee is relatively unsatisfying. You mileage may vary, I personally didn't think it was amazing.

- Bad Cameos

There's celebrity cameos in the game, and its glaringly obvious when you come across one. Especially when they're not good at voice acting. Grimes' character is one of the worst.

-Lacklustre AI

The driving AI is non-existent, cars will just follow a set path on the road, and if they get blocked they'll just stop and stay there. Crowd AI is ok, but will aggressively cull actors if they get startled. Combat AI is serviceable enough, they'll run for cover, occasionally throw grenades, or try to hack you.

--------

Overall, there's a lot to love here. While it isn't a perfect experience, you can really tell the devs loved this game, and wanted it to be a good experience, but the management at CDPR were more concerned with releasing for xmas. This game should have been delayed a year the first time they announced in April, and released Q2 2021.

But the foundations are there, and there's a lot that could be added to make the game amazing. This isn't as bad as No Man's Sky on release, but it has the same potential if the game is worked on in the same manner.

If bugs are a deal breaker for you, wait until feb/march when some more big patches come through. If you can get through them, then there's a genuine, sincere experience waiting here for you in Night City.",True
"The whole game itself is a big 100+ hours brain dance that will suck you in entirely, but unluckily CDPR is somehow ended up being evil corpocrits in the eyes of oldgen console gonks. 

Ofc there are bugs here and there, but in the end it will be all worth it.
Great story, greater music, even greater atmosphere.

"So to start this off I wont lie its got some hiccups but not enough to complain about unless you're a simple ""perfectionist"". Its the story driven game I've been wanting. Others may say its unplayable because they play on outdated hardware and the game could use a few patches. However despite these comments and the hiccups it does have, its still an awesome time in Night City.",True
"If all you care about is a subjectively great story, solid voice acting, a great soundtrack, and amazing visuals, this is the game for you. If not, look elsewhere since all this game has to offer right now are those 4 things. 

One big gripe that I had with this game was that the gameplay got stale over time. Especially once you realize that there is almost nothing else to do in Night City besides walk, drive and shoot people. 

Night City even tends to feel like you're walking in a beautiful painting or something at times. This is a good and a bad thing since it's proof that the city itself can look amazing (and that is assuming you have a relatively high-end PC...🙃), but then you realize that it's empty and completely lifeless. The main thing that could in the future hopefully help with that, is better AI. For now, though, it doesn't look good sadly. 
There are a few NPC's here and there holding convo's but that doesn't make a game feel 'alive'. I believe that if they added more activities to the game (even if they're super small) and improved the AI it could help balance that out and make the game feel more like an actual living and breathing world as opposed to how it is now.

I honestly cannot recommend Cyberpunk 2077 for the time being and would advise people to refrain from purchasing It.  At the very least, try and wait until they fix most of the bugs, the AI, and other performance issues bogging the game down.
The longer you wait to buy this the better honestly. Who knows, they might add previously cut content to the game 6 months to a year from now.

"Game has Issues ngl but the exp is so delightful and enjoyable that u will love it with all the probs and bugs.
totally recommended.",True
Minor bugs (Usually just NPC pathing issues). Great Story and game play.,True
"Dispite the horrible state it's been shipped in, it's a fantastic game. Wait until all the issues have been sorted and all the patches have been released. Then buy it.",True
"The story line of this game is on point, maybe not as good as the Witcher but considering this was CDPR's first attempt at creating a first person RPG game all by themselves (including the story line), it was pretty good. The graphical bugs I encountered can sometimes be irritating and there are sometime that quests take some time to load/progress but it is all bare-able for the story line we receive.  Sometime's the NCPD scanner events and other events do feel boring and are there just to fill in but I got to say that over-all the side quests we receive are very dynamic and not as monotonous as the Witcher.

I would genuinely recommend this game to everyone if you are fine with experiencing the bugs and have the money to buy it right now. But if you want a totally smooth experience I would tell you to wait out a bit for at least a month or two (or atleast till CDPR's fixes most of the bugs) before playing this game to have a bug-free experience.

- Langzeitmotivation und sehr viele Missionen neben der Hauptmission
- geile Musik und Geräuschkulisse
- Komplexes und großes Körperanpassungssystem (Cybermodifikation)

i do believe there is no need for me to say anything about the bugs but i will say one example of one i found. while i was driving an certain bike i found myself crashing into an lamp post but instead of flying to a wall, i was instead flying under the city center. story does its job of getting ones attention.

"Cyberpunk 2077, arguably the most hyped game of the entire year of 2020 made by a beloved company, CD Projekt Red. After putting many hours into the game, 100% the game on Very Hard, and achieving all 5 endings, I feel more than ready with my opinion on the game, and ready to state all the issues at least myself as a player went through, or as I have witnessed via other players that I know in real life and on the internet, but for the sake of the review, I will try to stay at only my own personal experiences. 


!![QUICK SUMMARY IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ THAT MUCH]!!- Yes, I do believe the game is worth the $60 and still even in it's current state, worth playing. However, there are a LOT of issues that I will be stating here so that you can decide if it's for you or not afterwards.


!![GAMEPLAY & GUNPLAY]!!- The combat play and movement mechanics in Cyberpunk 2077 are pretty clean and satisfying, however, the game is way too easy to manipulate. After the first 3 hours of in-game playtime, using my own builds was able to create a 1 shot revolver that would literally 1 shot anything, bosses included with just a body shot a lot of the time. Headshots were 20K+ damage, which is ridiculous. Then trying to make the game fun again and use a Katana with a point reset, I was able to create a Katana that 1 shot basically anything yet again. Even during the brawl side quests, it's so easy to manipulate the game and make it child's play, as heavy attacking someone around 3 times runs there stamina to 0 so they are literally stun locked as long as you can keep landing heavy blows and do a mix of light attacks. Overall, game is way to easy to create super overpowered builds.


!![GRAPHICS]!!- I run my PC on a 2080 Super [8GB] & a i7-9700K, so I had pretty good specs going into Cyberpunk, which having all the settings maxed out except a few on medium I had around 50-60FPS constantly, so FPS wasn't a real issue except in some areas which weren't well optimized I would go down to about 42~. The game in and of itself however doesn't look that bad. Typical triple A title game graphics of the past few years, so pretty good, but nothing really special.


!![STORY]!!- Cyberpunk's 2077 story, in my own personal opinion was kinda meh. I was extremely into the story and getting highly immersed during the first couple hours of gameplay and the starting stories. However, not many missions after Johnny was introduced, at least for myself personally, I gradually began to lose interest in the game as the story became stale at times, typical, or just overall not very interesting. I honestly had a more enjoyable time doing some of the 5~ minute side jobs than I did the entire story. Which to make matters worse, none of the endings were really all that good at all and none were actually satisfying or gratifying.


!![BUGS & GLITCHES]!!- The main issue and most talked about thing arguably in Cyberpunk 2077 right now is all the of the bugs and ways you can glitch the game. In my own personal playthroughs, I luckily never had any game-breaking issues. However I did have many bugs, a few even causing me to have to load back or even cause death. From things I have witnessed on other people's playthroughs that I was there in person when they happened, there are many times when gamebreaking issues can occur, as I had 1 friend have to load a save that was hours back to fix his issue, and another couldn't finish a side job no matter what as a person you are meant to talk to was bugged. However, in my own personal experience in my playthroughs, as I said earlier, I never had anything this serious. Just some standard bugs or T poses.


!![DRIVING]!!- I have had several people state that they personally do not like the driving, I may be the weird one out but the driving in this game was honestly my favorite part of the entire game. The driving mechanics were nice and pretty responsive, making it really enjoyable. There are also many cars to drive and choose from. HOWEVER, the one thing I personally dislike about the driving & vehicles in Cyberpunk 2077 is that the fastest car in the entire game is completely free and can be achieved and locked to your character as soon as you have access to roam around in the main game. Giving no real reason to drive any of the other cars or enjoyable in earning the car or any of the others you purchase. You can buy another color variant of the car later on, but you can quite literally just get the fastest vehicle before doing even 10% of the story or side jobs, which is a big negative to myself personally. 


!![NORMAL SUMMARY]!!- So, after reading all of this and me really having a lot of problems with the game and it has a lot of issues, I would still say the game is good and worth you time and money. This is because I still had a good and enjoyable time playing the game, but there were just a lot of times where I can see people getting bored or aggravated at the game. Which is why I feel the game is worth it, but you should only make your decision after knowing all the issues with it, as some of them could either steer you away or closer to buying the game. Hopefully this review has helped you with your decision on if you should buy it or not. Also, something I actually said and a good way to summarize my full blown feelings about Cyberpunk 2077 into two sentences would be this. ""After I finish this game, I will likely never play again through another playthrough. Though, I am glad I played this.""",True
Cool as ice.,True
"Its an okay game but I can't recommend it to anyone with the amount of game breaking bugs and crashes it has in its current state. Hopefully it gets fixed over time because the story, characters and side quests are genuinely fun.",False
"The game is buggy as all hell and clearly unfinished. No idea what CDPR were thinking, releasing it in this state after promising that it would come out ""when it's ready"".
Despite that, it's still a mostly fulfilling open-world experience. Lots of side content to keep yourself busy and entertained. Cute little Easter Eggs here and there. A very addictive photo mode. Fun gameplay, with many encounters to tackle your own way.
My advice, like any sensible person's, would be to wait until the big patches are complete, when the bugs are mostly ironed out, and the memes are dying down or turning more positive, before buying.",True
"I think people focus too much on the bugs in the game instead of appreciating the amount of detail and depth put in the story. The side quests especially make you explore parts of the city and meet characters that are so interesting! The dialogue options feel like they actually matter (and they do as they can make you change ur relationship with certain characters, which might give u extra quests or loot). I'm the type that usually skips dialogue and cutscenes, and cyberpunk is one of the rare games that despite having a complex plot can still suck me in its universe. Sometimes while im walking around, I like to look up at the sky and just enjoy the beauty of the city. I'm really enjoying how pretty the scenery is with RTX enabled, i think one of the goals of Cyberpunk was to achieve a futuristic aesthetic and I believe they succeeded.

Not only that, but the game discusses relevant topics like the impacts of giving corporations power (which feels like what the world is heading towards), AI consciousness and the desensitisation to sexual content, but in a non bias way. You get to listen to different opinions on these subjects by talking to different characters.  Overall, i recommend if you're a completionist who enjoys open world rpgs :)

(The game is definitely not perfect and has a ton of bugs, but none are that game breaking and if you spam f5, you can usually load recent saves without issues. Apart from the bugs and short main story, i think this is a great game. Also, I didn't even plan on buying the game on release because i thought it would be an overhyped piece of trash, but turns out im enjoying it way more than i expected)",True
"the story and side stories are stellar. the open world is par, maybe subpar depending on how hyped you were. i realize that cdpr did not deliver on a bunch of promises they made for this game, but i never kept up with those promises, so i went into the game pretty blind, despite being pretty hyped for it since the original announcement of the ip. this game has kept me hooked by the story alone. i don't think i'll replay it for the open world aspects, simply because the open world IS lacking. however, i will want to complete all of the story, side stories, and generally any content that has story or lore attached to it. also, to ppl who are complaining that your choices don't matter -- your choices DO matter. The thing is, the choices you make are kinda self-contained within their respective stories. Basically, there can be several possible ways for a particular questline to end, depending on your decisions and choices. They won't affect the overall world too much, and won't really factor into the potential endings you can get at the end of the main story. However, each of those self-contained stories (that i experienced at least) have been stellar. A+ writing when considering things in their self-contained aspects.

Edit: I've actually gone back and am working on a second playthrough, with almost the same character, besides changing the prologue backstory. After mulling over the ending I got, I REALLY wanted to dive back into the game because it was so melancholic.The story I have experienced so far on my second playthrough has been SURPRISINGLY different from my original playthrough. I've had interactions and quests that I never even saw in my first playthrough, despite almost playing through the same way in the early game. I can't really explain it too well, but when I mentioned that replayability would be pretty low, I now think that the replay value is pretty huge considering how *modified* of a story my second V is experiencing compared to my first.

Definite recommend for gamers with good enough rigs, or until CDPR patches the game to a better state on lower-end hardware.",True
"I will only comment on my experience. I absolutely adore this game. I'm not rich enough for an RTX-capable card, but a GTX 970 has meant a comfortable experience on High. The world presented is a rich, breathing city that truly feels alive. In my 40 hours (christ) so far, I've blasted through a hacking playthrough, and just started a more run-and-gun one. 

In this latter playthrough, I've stopped to actually experience the city, doing side-missions, random encounters, and exploring the nooks and crannies of the world. I've had very, very few bugs, and none of them game-breaking. Mainly a few floaty animations, a missing prop every now and again. Not any different to... Well, any other AAA game release of the last decade.

"After the nearly perfect game from CDPR, The Witcher 3, the game that took many risks, forced difficult decisions, and lovingly portrayed the bond of a man and his adopted daughter, we get the ""Eurojank GTA Clone,"" Cyberpunk 2077.  In a game like Cyberpunk, I expected themes of a world where reality is easily manipulated by technology, where implants control human consciousness.  Where human existence manipulates cyberspace.  What does it mean to be human?  Where is my mind?  Cyberpunk doesn't do any of this.  The closest thing we get is boring ""braindance"" sequences (which I found more enjoyable in the Batman Arkham games).  The concept of cyberspace is that everything is connected through an alternate world, free of the bounds of geography and the laws of physics.  In Cyberpunk, you have to have a line of sight to anything you want to hack, and it is limited to turrets, cameras, and a few damage effects to NPCs.  I don't even want to go into how uninteresting the augmentation and inventory systems are.  Buggy games are forgivable is they provide an addictive and compelling experience.  After playing for 15 hours, I'll finish the main storyline and uninstall it.  Gill was smart for not buying this game and creating an underpowered and uninteresting Cybermonk.",False
"I'm going to be honest, this game had a ton of bugs and people were pissed. But I loved it, the gameplay was fun itself, the gunplay felt nice and, for lack of other comparison, Borderlands-esque, and the story was great. The environment and atmosphere felt phenomenal and I enjoyed almost every side mission. The relationships you could build in this game was a nice touch. I finished my first playthrough around 50 Hours in and made it a personal goal to try and 100% the game, a feat I'm close to accomplishing at the time of this review (43/44, stupid cars :c). I've started another playthrough and I'm excited to try the other endings I've yet to see. 

The bugs were laughable at times, some even were funny. I didn't mind anything. The only major bug that happened to me was an area of the map had a rendering issue and caused my game to crash whenever I went near it. The hype surrounding the game, like many other games, caused a lot of inflated expectations and led to some disappointments. ""Some people expect this game to save their marriages,"" - moistcr1tikal.

Long story short, the game has its fair share of bugs and CD realized this and gave the opportunity for a refund on their product. I enjoyed every second I've played and I believe you will too. <3",True
"Cyberpunk 2077 is the best game I've ever played and It quickly became my favorite game of all time.

Let's start with my thoughts before the game was released. I thought the game would be a disappointment just because how people said it would be goty, masterpiece and they were literally saying Cyberpunk 2077 was their favorite game of all time even though the game wasn't released yet. People wouldn't stop talking about this game and when this happens, normally I get disappointed after the game is released but not in this case.

 I was really heartbroken when I launched the game and saw some freezes, fps drops, bugs, crashes and etc but after some research and helpful videos on youtube I managed to boost my fps up to 50-70 on ultra settings 1080p. I couldn't play the game (story) for first 2-3 hours because I didn't want to ruin experience because of fps drops, crashes and so on.

 After fixing FPS Problem that's when the adventure began. 

 Starting with Graphics - DAMN... this game is BEAUTIFUL!!! I wanted to screenshot everything and when I'm saying everything trust me... EVERYTHING! Even the places where were nothing but trash looked so beautiful. I am still blown away! 

 Story - Cdprojekt Red knows how to make a great game with breathtaking story. I was attached to characters from the beginning. I don't want to spoil anything for you but - Jackie Welles became and will always be my best friend! You have couple different endings and your choices matter which is pretty cool! 

 Side quests - Okay the story is breathtaking but what happens when you finish the game? You can start from the beginning and try different ending or there are great Side quests which will entertain you.

 Map - The map isn't HUGE but it's pretty big to me. You can explore many beautiful and interesting places, take screenshots, drive with your car/bike and have fun!

 Soundtracks - Soundtracks are one of the most important things for me and Cyberpunk 2077 didn't disappoint. Those soundtracks make me feel like I'm the most badass person in the world. 

 Character customization - Cdprojekt Red took character customization to the next level. You can even customize your friend down there. Yeah you know what I'm talking about... Size, shape, hair all there :D 

 Difficulty - The game can be anything from peaceful to hell. You get to choose difficulty but the thing is... Police in this game... Well I am really scared of police in this game - I'll just say this, I want you to experience it yourself. All the players will know what I mean.

 The game has many bugs, you'll still experience fps drops in the streets because everything is moving/glowing literally and you might experience game crashes but the game was released just now and Cdprojekt Red got it. Witcher 3 wasn't without problems either but look at it now. The game is a masterpiece!

 To summarize - Cyberpunk 2077 is a game with breathtaking Graphics, Story, Soundtracks, Characters, Side Quests, Character Customization and great map. It has bugs, fps drops, crashes and if you don't have strong nerves it might make you angry but the game is still amazing and I know patches, updates, fixes are on their way.

If you read till here you are breathtaking! Happy Gaming friend!",True
"Let's start with the cons right away. Buggy, crashes from time to time, misses advertised features that frankly are depressing. I waited a long time for this game, pre-ordered it about 2 years in advance, and despite all of that, I'm... Not disappointed.


The game just grips you by the throat, haven't felt so many different emotions in an entertainment medium in a good while. The story, the characters, the music, and the atmosphere. Going through it all, is worth it alone, for me. 


That is why I recommend it, despite my anger at CD Projekt Red for giving me an unfinished game, that it could be so much more than it is. The devs deserve praise for their ambitions and to the extent, they delivered on before the suits rolled in and ordered them to wrap it up. The game is amazing. 


Edited after playing about 200 hours. I love the game yet I know it can be more.",True
"Here we are after so many years of waiting for CDPR's new masterpiece, and is it a masterpiece? Far from it. Now let me first say that I did enjoy my 64 hours with the game clearing out all the side gigs, NCPD hustles, and almost all the side jobs. I would ultimately recommend the game, just not for $80 at this time and I will explain why. I also won't speak to bugs or glitches as they are quite prevalent in this game at this time. The issues lie in the meat of the game or lack thereof. (TLDR below)

The game has beautiful art direction and design making Night City really come to life with that Cyberpunk style that so many love. However, there is little variety of what you can do in Night City. Outside of the main quests and the stand out side jobs, you mostly have the same styled side gigs/hustles to do and that really is it, so you better enjoy the base game-play loop a lot. Me personally I switched between Shotguns, Street Brawling and Stealth so I never had an issue with things getting stale, but for someone who only does things one way I can see how it could could stale easily. Aside from these quests that repeat the same loop you can get a couple race missions, but for variety that is about it. The best comparison is Fallout 4, no joke, there are quests with some story to them and have cool stuff going on, but then the major meat is doing the same kind of mission many many times (there it was the liberation of camps/outposts.) Now there were definitely a good deal of fun quests that had some cool lore or action going on, but the side gigs/hustles (which make up the meat) are very same-y.

Also would have been nice to have vehicles play a more active role in the game and not just as transport. What do I mean by this? Have actual vehicle combat or races that you can't just use the NPC's vehicle. So that your choice of vehicle is more meaningful. The cars did look and feel awesome I will say so kudos to them for making driving feel good and capturing the cyberpunk style in the vehicles.

I was also disappointed that the origins you start with don't have more effect, yes they affect dialogue choices, but after that? nothing really it seems. After talking to friends about their choices it doesn't seem to affect much else. I could be wrong and it could affect more, but so far I haven't been able to tell from my or my friends experiences. Also the prologue pending your kind of origin is WAY too short especially for something they talked up so much. Speaking of dialogue, the dialogue (I thought) was decently written and well voice-acted which is something I appreciate as the alternative is immersion shattering. The dialogue sadly isn't all that impactful as it feels like nothing you do or say really affect what comes later.

I could keep going but what I am trying to illustrate is that while it is a good game with positives it has negatives that are almost equal in number. Is it perfect? No. Is it revolutionary? Not it you have played Fallout 4, Deus Ex or Shadowrun. But is it fun? I think so.

The TLDR is this; it is a flawed, but fun game (this is forgetting the bugs mind you) that I was able to get good quality and quantity of time out of. However, you might not be able to if you don't really enjoy the game-play loop or find ways to keep it from getting stale. Would I recommend? Yes. But at $80? only for Cyberpunk mega-fans or those who can get really engrossed in exploration because Night City is amazing to traverse/explore. The rest should wait for a sale.",True
"Too many bugs to count.

Performance is terrible on recommended hardware irrespective of max or min settings. Forget a constant 60 fps unless you own a RTX 3080 or higher.

A lot of features hinted to and shown in trailers and gameplay footage are missing from the game.

AI means all NPCs duck at the same time when you fire a weapon, cops spawn 2 feet behind you when you commit a crime and guards see bodies through walls/floors/ceilings during ""stealth"" missions.

Too many bugs to count (yeah I know I already said this).

I got a refund, did you?",False
"Game really needs some polishing and optimization before i can say its worth the full price, main story is also insanely short for a cdpr game at roughly 20-30 hours max i'd say , game is also pretty buggy at times and poorly optimized like i mentioned earlier. Most of the side content just doesn't feel like it's worth doing at the moment, especially the police shootouts/gang activity stuff. This game is pretty much how new vegas was on release (really buggy and not as highly acclaimed as it is now as on release) and hopefully it can end up being like new vegas 5-10 years from now with a dedicated modding community and good replayability.",False

For me, this game is amazing in every way...

"Okay so this game has some bug problems and optim issues. HOWEVER. This game and it's story are unbelievable. The story by itself could hold this game up as it was amazing. Much like The Witcher 3, the game was also fairly unoptimized however they ALWAYS fix these things. Amazing now, will only get even better with time and thats a guarantee.",True
"I have played this game a great deal and I have enjoyed it thoroughly, despite the bugs, despite the launch. 

I haven't been this invested in stories and characters in a game or movie or any form of media like I am with Cyberpunk 2077 in a long time. The story, characters, and facial expressions are a breath of fresh air in an environment that is otherwise saturated with cardboard cutouts with drawn on eyebrows. 

This game also has Judy Alvarez. She is the best character ever. I love Judy.

Based on the game as presented, with the good (gameplay, story, etc) and the bad (buggy launch, cut features, etc), I give this game a 8/10.

Based on the fact that this game has Judy Alvarez in it...

"Games good all but the bugs that aren't game breaking or interfering. Don't know where these complaints on crashes come from, update your PC build maybe? Couple patches and it'll be chips and gravy. 

Redacts making arguments like ""Many of the NPCs in the game have cool looking cybernetic eyes, arms, and legs, but your character has no access to any of that"" need to BTFO - you get those customisation's as you play the game you redact. 

Fix the bugs, add some more features, everyone will chill.

"Hello everyone, looking for my opinion about this game.

My hype started in January 2020 when I heard a rumour about a Cyberpunk genre game made by the creators of Witcher 3. This made me very hyped already since I like futuristic games and liked the Witcher very much. This made me obsessed with the game and with everything around it. Like watching Night-City Wire and all their video’s and twitter posts.

After the first delay it was okay and fine. After the delay at September I got a bit angry but at the same time I couldn’t since it wasn’t ready for them yet to be released. I got along with it and waited till release day December 10th.

Release day:
I preloaded the game and waited on the exact minute to get the game and play it. When I first started it, I was so excited and at the same time I read some reviews a little bit early and saw they found a lot of bugs. Either way my head was: “Ok there are going to be bugs but nothing major”. Well I played the game for 4 hours. Only found a couple of bugs like NCP’s walking over a fence or stuff like walking through a wall. Other thing is that I quickly found out my friend who was playing the game as well (discord Livestream). Picked up a bug with grass/vegetation glitching and lighting the wrong way. Like a big overlay on your screen. This upset him very much which I get because it’s annoying that the game just won’t work. But when I look at the game, I see immersive conversations with so many choices. At the same time with my game (no grass glitch). A f*cking cool and mesmerising view. I never had a game that I made this many screenshots in and stopped playing just to make a screenshot of the game.
Day after:
After I played a lot and came back 1 of my friends became so angry that the game had bugs he refunded it with me still holding true to the CDPR developing I said there is going to be a patch soon that will fix a lot of those. I’m just going to go play and see through those bugs Ill focus on my gameplay instead of the whole game. Which I found out the gameplay is good if you are conversation based with small objectives. When you go full combat mode it becomes a bit boring in early game and in late game. Mid game the combat was amazing and balanced, you can die if you don’t watch out, but you can stomp that voodoo gang member (Hostile Gang Member) if you hit your shot’s/blade cuts. It’s a bit of a let down and at the same time super amazing. Which comes to the part of Job’s/Side missions/Gig’s/Rides. I saw at the side quest list and OMG there are a lot of them, and those gigs are still coming through and I haven’t even found them all. At the same time haven’t even completed them or found all the gigs/Side missions but there is a lot to see in this city. Which makes me come to the rides. You must get through the city somehow. I loved that you got that car at the start but made me mad you couldn’t customize your car! Like ITS ABOUT CUSTOMIZATION why not my car… But later I found out you can but car’s/steal them and then add them to your car and they are modified. Later I found it quite okay since I got my hands on a Delamain Taxi which has the smoothest handling I needed in the game to get around. After all that stuff I found out that you can respond to text of your friends and they will respond differently which made my immersion even better since conversations make it super great.

Final Stop:
Ok Here it is if I really like it or not. You can battle anything that I just said but for me the game was almost to nearly bugless. Which made my experience ++. I get that some people haven’t had this experience which made me kind of sad. But only thing I could recommend is reinstalling the game and hoping for the fix. But if you look at the Witcher 3 at launch it was WORST then cyberpunk 2077 is at this moment. Just look at how they turned that game from flop to game you must have played if you have a good pc and love slashing. This is that game as well only different genre and it just has to be patched and then it will be even better then Witcher 3.

My final verdict:
Graphics:				         	10/10
Gameplay:					8/10
Depth of Guns/Cyberware:		6/10
Conversation:					10/10
Characters:					9/10
Depth of Characters/backstory’s:	8.5/10
Story:						9/10
Bugs (If it’s hinders the game) :	3/10

Overall Score:					9.5/10

This is going to be a game I’ll be playing more and hope they can find a quick fix for most of the bugs that people have encountered meanwhile I’m going to cruise in my fancy Delamain Taxi around this City with my mouth wide open.

"The game was falsely advertised. This is nowhere near the next gen open world rpg they were bragging about for years. Apart from bugs and glitches, lots of promised features are simply not there.

Really disappointed and did not expect this from CD Project Red.

Well played, marketing team, you got me this time.",False
"Despite all the bad press, this game is amazing. Yes, bugs exist in this game but in my 35 hours so far they are just going to be a part of my cherished gaming experiences. The world is huge and immensely engaging. The characters are diverse and interesting to learn more about. I constantly find myself shushing my friends so I can listen to a line of NPC dialogue. I recommend this game to anyone looking for a good mix of RPG and combat.",True
"I loved Cyberpunk 2077, I really do.

I completed the campaign twice and spent over 170 hours on it.

But we were promised so much and were given so little.

Looking at their recently announced roadmap, it's very clear that in 2021 CDPR is going to completely focus on making the game playable on old gen consoles and fixing all the bugs instead of giving us the content that were promised to us. Even DLCs seemed like an afterthought at this point. 

Take a look at patch 1.1, sure it fixed some bugs here and there, but it added new ones as well. Cyberpunk still has a long road ahead of it before it becomes the game that was promised to us. If you haven't bought it yet, do not buy it until 2022 at the earliest.

Do not condone behavior like this on triple A titles, especially for a developer on the caliber of CDPR.

Cyberpunk 2077 is a great game, it's just a shame that it wasn't the masterpiece it could've been.",False
"If your pc can run it, shut up, ignore the bugs and gliches and enjoy the touching story. Now I am depressed, I feel empty cause Night City became part of me and I just finished the game.",True
"[h1]This game wasn't ready. [/h1]

[u] Pros [/u]
+ Beautiful world
+ Engaging enough missions 
+ Some fun characterisation/characters
+ Lots of attention to detail (in terms of aesthetics)

[u] Cons [/u]
- Night City is empty of anything to do when off the clock (not doing missions/ entering combat); nothing to do in bars except fill your inventory with health items; No downtime activities; shallow social interactions with NPCs with a lack of features that were promised in marketing prior to release; no use for cars (which can't be customised in any way) beyond getting from point A to B, and so on...
- Lack of cosmetic character customisation post character creation.
- A sandbox map without any sandbox elements, meaning there are very few characters to happen across and many contacts you engage with for missions or gigs, are not met in the world but instead all call you during Act 2. 
- In its current build, police do not have any behaviour beyond opening fire if you get too close...or teleporting behind you if you gain a wanted level. They don't give chase and will even appear next to you out of thin air inside buildings, completely breaking immersion. 
- There are plenty of bugs and I suspect memory leaks based on how many issues start to creep in the longer you play the game.
- Lore specific details (such as certain gang members having glowing neon tattoos) seem to be missing despite still being used in official artwork for the game.
- Vehicles handle like you're driving on a road made out of butter. 
- Ai traffic can't handle any kind of obstacle and will often block roads and yet in some rare cases they will instead plow right through a barricade while the driver swears at the player. 
- The map is useless, showing icons all over the city (which gives the player little reason to explore by themselves) but never listing what you've actually discovered. Want to go to a specific location or bar or fixer? You will have to google where they are if you forget. 
- Many social interactions seem to be missing in dialogue trees. You'll often meet a character for the first time and speak like old friends or jump in halfway through a conversation like you haven't just walked in off the street. Then you have no way of exiting a conversation, instead just having to awkwardly walk away. 
- There are no options to change up key bindings/control options. There's no walk toggle (nor crouch nor aim toggle that I can find). 
- NPCs calling you interrupts whatever you're doing and sometimes can't be ignored, leading to overlapping conversations.
- Attachments for weapons don't list which specific weapons they're compatible with meaning you have to manually go through weapons trying to see what fits like attaching lego blocks.
- Night City feels empty with huge areas that have been beautifully crafted serving absolutely no purpose.
- Life paths are over in a flash, leaving just the odd dialogue option in the main game. An early game montage of interesting events that plays out in a cutscene, should have been numerous missions worth of content in the prologue. 
- There are just two sex workers in the game/ the whole city, and they only cost 100 eurodollars a go, which is a scandal considering they must be the two hardest working people in Night City.",False

"It has bugs, it has glitches.

My experience with cyberpunk so far has been enjoyable, the combat seems a bit basic, stealth is overpowered, hacking is interesting to use, melee seems pretty basic, it's just mainly bashing left click. I like that you are able to customize the weapons, add silencers, scopes, chips that are helpful for stealth.

The skill system is like of any other RPG, you get skill points, you put them into skill trees. Some doors in the game require you to have a specific level of body or intelligence to get into, some dialogue options require you to have a specific level in the ""cool"" category, some require body and so on, this puts depth into dialogues, and kind of forces you to be a jack of all trades.

The character creation is pretty interesting, there are only 2 voices you can choose from, a feminine and a masculine, 2 body types that are feminine and masculine as well, lots of choices on your hair, eyes, even fingernails. You can choose your genitalia but it seems like it's more for laughs.

The story and the characters you meet is amazing, mostly everything comes together in the ending, the different characters feel alive when they call you with jobs or just information about past jobs, what they did. It is pretty immersive but the glitches like characters stopping talking or broken animations break the immersion barrier.

The world is pretty vast, it has interesting areas, different regions, driving seems to be too sensitive at most times. There are a lot of quest areas around but they are pretty much the same. Eliminate target, Eliminate all targets, Steal the item.

I guess this game depends on the person who plays it. Some might be let down because the game was hyped to hell and back and they expected more, but it is a new game, in every newly released game there are optimization issues, bugs and glitches. I believe the game developers are going to fix everything in time, so i recommend anyone who is interested in the game to buy it after 2 months of it release so that they would not be so disappointed.",True
"Guys, Go to nvidia control panel -> Manage 3D Settings -> OPENGL Rendering GPU (Set ur GPU here) and u can also edit the power management mode underneath but this isnt too important, Also go to configure surround physX (on the lefthand side) and set ur GPU here too under the ""processor"" thing. This doubled my fps (using an RTX 3080 on max settings) and according to my friends using 1070's and etc it has also massively increased performance.",True
a bit buggy but still really good. The story telling is just amazing,True
Biggest joke of 2020,False
"7/10 Would not reccomend to play without dlc or expansions, game feels rushed and lacks a lot of content.

-Main story is too short, 20h for main quest in big rpg game is just joke (When I though i was in middle of story, I was on ""point of no return"" mission lol);
-AI is bugged/dumb, especially in stealth;
-Very few good side quests that can be found on map (question marks),most of map quests are just ""go there, kill everyone or kill cyberpsyho and bam u did it"" ,after Witcher 3 I'm really disappointed
-Only 2 romances for main story is disappointment as well.
-Completely useless V house which u can't even customize
-Bugs, although it's not a big deal
-Game is not challenging me at all (3rd diff level), boss fights are too easy
-Main story is too linear, only in the end game will give us a real(illusion of) choice which can affect story
-Endings killed any replayability for me because all my efforts doesn't matter at all
-80% of skills are completely useless and don't make any difference at all
-Crafting is no needed and takes too much recourses
-No mini-games
-Can't change hairstyle
-Character creator is meh, seen a lot better

"No. Just no. Awful performance. Lies from the developer of what would be included in the game. Immersion breaking bugs that ruin what would be heartfelt moments. Repetitive nature of everything not a main or side quest. If you like ubisoft collectathon icon hunting, you might like it. Disjointed tones and voice acting between optional dialogue (blue) and mandatory dialogue (yellow). Your character may be calm in the blue dialogue, then randomly yelling in the yellow dialogue. Lifepaths don't matter. Everybody has the same start after a rushed opening then a montage that shows you cool shit you'd rather be playing.

Very little role playing in this RPG. V has a very defined personality that you can't change. Dialogue options are worse than Fallout 4's, and those got mocked to hell. Loot is very boring dps check loot that doesn't really change the way you play the game. Armor is a boring stat pad with no transmog or option to hide headwear. Cyberware - cybernetic augments- are also all majorly stat pads with very few that offer new and exciting ways to play the game. Absolutely no way to customize character after starting character creation. Street cred is a meaningless number just to block you from buying certain things early. Stats are very imbalanced because hacking/stealth is so much worse than just running and gunning/slicing without any pay off. Perks that increase weapons are boring stat pads that offer nothing exciting. On top of that, some perks are broken and just don't work half the time (Such as the blades perk of healing and gaining movement speed on kill.) Some cyberware also randomly breaks. Both Blood Pump - a on demand 60% heal- and Sandevistan - a on demand 75% time slow- can randomly break and become useless.

The story is alright, but feels incredibly rushed. The side quests are really good and the characters in them are the only reason I'm going to keep playing this to the end.

All in all, this game should have been delayed another 1-2 years because it is very clearly not ready to release. Stay away until then, and I will update this review after the patches come out.

Edit #1 I've now 100% completed the game, done all the achievements, and completed a 2nd run with a different lifepath / build. Really really disappointed lifepaths do no matter, and disappointed that the ending credits dialogue does not change even if you are a different gender and romance different people. Still do not recommend it. None of the patches that have released have fixed any major bugs (aside from the save file one), and I actually encountered more game breaking bugs in my second playthrough than in my first.",False
"Is the game good? Yes
Are the bugs game breaking? No

Was the game over-hyped? Very much so. I believe the only reason this wasn't another no mans sky was because they did actually deliver on some of the promises they made. The game was obviously in no state to be released at least with my experience. Iv made it about halfway through the main campaign, doing a few side missions along the way and I can't say I'm impressed or disappointed. This game is just average. I think we were all expecting the next big thing for video games, we all thought that this would be the game that would change video games forever but to me at least, its just another footnote. I suppose we will have to keep waiting for that one game to come along that will change everything forever.",False

To add onto this: 
-no driving AI (cars follow their on-rail preset paths, they don't solve problems or drive around an obstacle, just sit there and wait for it to move (many open world games have this - see GTA V, a 7 year old game)
-no customisation - a CYBERPUNK game where you're locked into your appearance completely after the initial character creation (even Witcher 3 had a barber shop at least)
-police system is a joke, no car chases, when you get a wanted level the drones and cops just spawn behind you, no bounty system

"[NOTE] I am a CDPR fanboy - and that's okay. However, this review is unbiased and based on my raw experience with the game without some Twitter feed raging in my ear about performance problems. This review is also subject to change with future patches and/or any other remarks I wanted to add but forgot at the time.

I want to preface this review with a few things:

- I encountered a variety bugs, but not game breaking or immersion breaking ones. Small ones like the odd T-pose from a character, or some dialogue overlaying each other. It's small and inconsequential to me - I still had fun. Yes, it is unfortunate the game suffers from them, but at the end of the day, how nitpicky must one be to be frustrated with small hiccups like that? Now I know, some people didn't get the experience I got on any of the platforms. THAT IS 100% OKAY. Voice your concerns/ opinions, but don't bash on the devs for a game that we know will get patched up and lookin' pretty very soon. You know this, I know this, lets move on. 

- I played on a single character. Street Kid, reached Level 50 (max) and Level 50 Street Cred (max). I completed every major storyline that the available NPC's provided (i.e Panam + her romance, River, Rogue, Johnny, Judy, etc etc etc). At time of writing I still have the smaller Gigs to complete just for the sake of loot and filler story.

My experience with the game was fantastic. Reasons being that I didn't go in with high expectations. I knew that the ambition of the game had got to the heads of some fans, and their experience was then dulled when they opened a buggy game. This is where they fell short of an awesome experience. My anticipation for this game prior to this year was incredibly high though. I wanted noting more than to sink my teeth into this game as soon as possible. I didn't mind the delays, as the worked out in my favour. If I were to ask for another delay - I would.

You see, Cyberpunk 2077 doesn't innovate on anything. It doesn't revolutionise how we see/ play games. It just utilises a formula for story and illusion really, REALLY well. 

The player's opening hours aren't all too meaningful - where Lifepaths were once sold to define how your character experiences the game. The game ""kind of"" does that, in the way of some simple dialogue options. Sometimes, the dialogue options help you gain info on what the important option is (i.e if you're a Street Kid and Dum Dum offers you a ""whiff"" of his AirHypo, Street Kids can opt to find out what kind of AirHypo it is, thus reassuring that it's fine to take). 

Perhaps I read into the dialogue too much. I loved the story, but it's that kind of digging that helps you appreciate the story a whole lot more. Dialogue is CDPR's bread and butter, and they've made a story you can believe in, and relive multiple times and not be bored by it. My decisions I made felt important (upon a few Google searches I did learn it didn't matter as much. But who cares?), and it always urged me to pick carefully in future events. This is what pulls me back to play again.  

Characters are beautifully written. During my time with the game, there was never a time where I felt I should skip dialogue. Each character offers a different taste of life in Night City. From Panam's fight for acceptance from her clan, to Johnny's conflict with V. Each story feels real. There are times where characters can flip on their own personality or choices and act differently than expected. But, the overall  presentation goes without fail. [b] In short, the story was amazing and well written with the cast of characters presented [/b]

The world. Holy did I fall in love with Night City at first sight. The sheer scale and size of the buildings, locales, streets, roads and the Badlands. It felt like it existed. I will say that with the current state of driving (which is near impossible to turn corners with Mouse + Keyboard...sometimes with controller too). that roads (if they're not highways) were a nightmare to drive on. In-game ads/ tv shows/ radio/ soundtracks are well made and sell the theme of the corporate megacity. Ads repeat themselves often, and you will begin to notice. There's 2 ways to look at it: On one hand, you can see it as an immersion device that describes ""Oh f**k, the same ad today"" or on the other hand its a technical shortcoming, ""this is just annoying. There needs to be more"". Again, a tiny detail that shouldn't be looked so hard into. 

Gameplay. This is a tough one. E3 2018 suggested some pretty high octane shooting and driving. But most of it was fabricated when it came to release. Car chases were a scripted event and never occurred outside of main missions. 
 - Tailing cars/ people had almost no consequence if you got too close or too far. 
 - Enemy alert systems are primitive and doesn't really warrant playing stealthily if you're equipment is far more deadly than the enemy. Guns blazing typically wins. 
 - The police system is an utter joke in that getting any form of bounty just means ""we'll spawn cops behind you, regardless of your location. And they'll either murder you or you'll drive off in your car and we'll pretend it never happened"".
- Crowd AI behaviour breaks the illusion of a lived in city when you freak them out and they all despawn when you spin in a circle. It feels like a handful of important, supporting features like this did not get out of a prototype phase. I just wasn't convinced that this was what I waited years for.
- Mentioned earlier, but driving can be improved. It's okay, but can be better. Brakes are non-existent - the time to stop for any vehicle is possible around 4 seconds. In that time I've hit 3 pedestrians, blasted a truck into the sky, and now all the panelling on my sick sports car is gone. Cars feel weightless as they shoot of into the heavens if you drive too fast over a small bump. I'm exaggerating but you know what I mean.
- Gunplay was fun. The thing that set it back was the game's economy. Money was tedious to accumulate, I never felt like I was getting stronger until I invested in the Mantis Blades, which wasn't until I was mid-game territory. For a game about augmenting your body, it does take a good while before you can get your first substantial upgrade (which we all wanted).
- Melee combat is great. Katana? F**k yeah. I will note that dropping down from a height without a prompt to drop assassinate and rely on ""just landing on them"" to kill is a bit janky. This game screams Sci-fi Dishonored in some areas. So let it be inspiration for Quality of Life improvements.
- Skill Trees were okay. Some skills such as picking up an enemy right after you assassinate them should just be an outright passive from the beginning, and not locked behind a high level attribute tree. Others I felt I could live without regardless of what build I made. 

Should you play this game? Yes, but it depends. Sadly, the state of the game doesn't allow me to scream ""PLAY IT NOW"", because to achieve the best experience, you need a powerful computer. The game is gorgeous with or without raytracing. Consoles will not do this justice in my honest opinion, at least not until the round of patches come out. Until then, PC is the way to go. But no promises.

I've probably missed some areas. I'll fixed them at some point.
TL;DR: I loved the game, but I do and I do not, recommend this product.

"""Far from a Masterpiece, but it has potential to be one""

I'm gonna review this game with no regards to the bugs that I have encountered but based on the contents I have played and experienced throughout the 60 hours I have spent on this game. Yes 60 hours I have spent (all gigs completed, all side jobs completed, extensive crafting.. some NCPD missions)

The first 40 hours I played this game I was starting to hate it the more I play it, thankfully the main story and the side jobs were very interesting and decent payoffs from those missions kept me going and I appreciate the writing of those stories. Yes, once again CDPR came up with a very engaging story to motivate myself finishing it. I just wished it was way longer. Gunplay is decent, love the sniper rifle especially, melee combat needs some work as its too basic. Hacking is essential to this game (For me) and crafting as well. The graphics are amazing even running on Medium settings. The music is awesome as well. Of course, I really love the characters involved in the main story as well as the side jobs. Johnny Silverhand is cool af. 

There are many things that I hate/disappointed in this game. I'll put it in a list below;
- Barebones customizations. No car customizations, lacking gun customizations.
- Gigs can sometimes feel very repetitive/lazy.
- No Mini games (such as Gwent from Witcher).
- Shit driving mechanics
- ONLY 2 HOOKERS.
- Lame romance options (but i love my choice, dammit i love her)
- Bad UI.
- Weird controls (c to skip and c to crouch??) 
- Gang affiliations are non-existent. Every gang seems to hate me outside of missions. 

The developers had 8 years building this game. They could put in as much content as they want to make NIGHT CITY feel more alive. If they would've have addressed the issues above I am confident that this game could potentially be a Masterpiece.

Gameplay - 7/10

OVERALL RATING 
This is pretty hard after finishing the game. But I would settle around 7.5/10.

"Cyberpunk 2077 is a game based in the year 2077. You play as V, residing in a dystopian place known as Night City.

My thoughts on the game:

- Very well made. The writing is great, the character development is great as well. The graphics of this game are incredible, and it is breathtaking to look at while playing.
- The shooting gives me Escape From Tarkov vibes. I like it. A ton.
- Guns are not to OP or weak in my opinion. They're customizable, so you can add Mods, like sights or suppressors. You can also add a mod for making your gun stronger or weaker. (Crit, Reload Speed, etc.) 
- The side quests are intriguing, and you can get swept up in them easily. I'm saying it's well written, and just as fun as the main quests or just rolling around.
- Character Customization is wonderful. I love how there are more than just like 20 hairstyles, and they actually look decent.
- One thing that I LOVE from this game is the grab and kill/knockout mechanic. I am a HUGE Splinter Cell fan, and it gave me such SC vibes, I was shivering it was so cool. You can also hack technology, which is similar to Watchdogs. It's really cool to see this game have things we enjoy from other games.
- You can modify the character with Ripperdocs, which can make him even stronger, smarter, and it looks sick.

I played on a RTX 2060 Super // AMD Ryzen 5 2600. I had around 60FPS playing on Ultra Settings with DLSS on Balanced. Ray Tracing is a little too buggy at this rate, at least for me. Ultra is still beautiful though. I didn't have a problem.

The game is in quite a buggy state, but not game breaking... Or at least from what I have discovered. If you do really have any problems, just manually save the game and reload it. Should fix your problems. If that doesn't work, just rollback to an autosave. But again, it doesn't happen very much, at all.

There are a lot of beautiful vehicles you can drive, which are pretty fast, so you can drive around. You can also Fast Travel at certain locations as well.

CD Projekt Red did great with Johnny Silverhand as well. Voiced by Keanu Reeves, Johnny is this bad-ass character that doesn't give a frick about anyone except himself. However, as time progresses, he shows his morals and what he truly cares about. It's so cool to see a person change, and another reason why I love this game. And I'm only 26 hours in as of now, but I love it.

Great game. Fix the bugs, and some more optimization fixes to get better frame rates, and it will be a game I play for years. I'll still probably be playing for the next year though. <3

Thanks for reading!",True
"Bugs can and will be fixed. What's left is a beatiful but relatively shallow action RPG. For some reason, Cyberpunk 2077 doesn't make me care about its characters, or my overall goals in the game. I'm 40 hours in and still have to visit Jackie Welles' mother... The main missions are beautifully crafted and the dialogue is top notch, with excellent voice acting. But these never seem to really impact the linear road V is travelling. Outside the main mission there is zero meaningful interaction with NPC's. That said, the side quests will get repetitive soon, because every mission will boil down to a stealth op or going in guns blazing to steal something or rescue someone/something. These missions are lifted above average because of the hacking mechanics and fun upgrades/implants/cyberware. Although the combat against brainless enemy AI feels a bit underwhelming, the visuals are a sight to behold. Weapons feel powerful and there's a lot of them to pick from. 

Don't get me wrong, I will be playing Cyberpunk 2077 a lot the coming weeks/months, but I think I was expecting a deeper experience that what's being offerd to me right now.",True
"I've just finished the game with 59.8h. And I'm blown away by what CDPR did with the story.

First of all, I'm not at all in favor of what CDPR did with the launch of the game, specially with the console players. I'm sad that they can't experience what I've just experienced.

So, what I've to say about the game...

First the gameplay. It's simple but fun, reminds me a lot of Deus Ex, in a good way... the hacks, the gunplay... There's a lot to improve tho, the looting system is not good, you pick up every single item you see in front of you, and when you can't carry anything more, you start to get rid of what you don't need, and then repeat. The clothing system has the same problem as every other open world rpg with gear levels... you put what it's bet on your character and until it starts to look like a fucking clown, they need a Transmog system ASAP.

The history is what kept me engaged in the game for so long. The way they manage the relationship between Johnny and V is amazing. I'm not going to tell spoilers here, but this is what will keep you playing too... every single dialog line from Johnny made me laugh a little, or feel anger for his personality, sadness for what he's been through, and so on.

There are two types of side quests in the game, the Gigs (that can be easily compared to the witcher contracts in The Witcher 3), and the normal side quests. The Gigs are just mercenary jobs, the majority are pretty simple and repetitive, but there's some that shine, that requires some thought into it.
The side quests are pretty good, what we could expect from CDPR... there are some side quests that are really memorable, with shocking stories, or just some laughs.

Honestly, for me, I would start a new playthrough right now, but I'm going to wait for some patches or when they start releasing the dlcs.

I highly recommend the game... it's been some time since I don't get emotional with the ending of a game... the last one that did this to me was The Witcher 3, and prior to it, Life is Strange.",True
"I've had Johnny Silverhands quest dialogue stuck on my screen for about 20 hours of my playtime, i've had a random bugged quest NPC stuck following me for 2 straight days, clipped through a few walls, random deaths a few times, objects not loading in.

-Not a huge fan of driving on PC they should really add some sensitivity sliders for driving, you really gotta feather your adadadad's or you're gonna have a bad time.
-AI is terrible all around
-No options for transmog make your character super ugly if you're planning on actually taking advantage of armor for clothing needed on higher difficulty's of the game
-really poor optimisation, i settled on mid and low , mob density low for 60 fps

+The story and the side missions keep me coming back, and i estimate at least 200 hours of game-play for me without additional DLC

Despite all the hate and the disgusting filthy bug infested mess, best game of 2020",True
"Sure it has bugs but what do you expect form a game not done...

Theres so much to do in the Night city and the area surrounding it. The missions are good and keep you intrested.

If you get bored by the conversations of the npc's and want more action you can just go around defeating thugs for their bounties or for street cred.

I cant wait to see whats next for the game.",True

"After waiting for several years to dive into the dystopian world of Cyberpunk 2077 and finishing the main story arc, it is time to gather my thoughts on this long-awaited experience.

First of all, after the success of the Witcher series and my cautious trust in the skills and craftsmanship of CDPR, I hardly could imagine the state of the game at its release. I encountered bugs. Lots of bugs. Maybe the sudden release delay really was a red flag ... To be honest, I would have bought the game anyway, because dark dystopian and futuristic settings are simply my cup of tea.

My verdict is: I liked the journey to Night City. So much so, that I’m am definitely going to play each and every DLC coming my way. But sadly, the experience was not quite, what I anticipated. After all these promising trailers and that absolutely enticing source material, I imagined a grand tour through a realistic and disturbing version of our potential future. Choke full of interesting characters, solid gameplay and a thought-provoking plot, that stays with you much longer, than a playthrough. 

Unfortunately, the game just can’t deliver in each regard. Some characters were truly remarkable, and some quests absolutely managed to capture the vibe of everything I have hoped. But overall, the main storyline, which is, what is the most important part for me, because I don’t need a second job doing all the Open World busy work, kind of let my expectations down. Not only are there very few missions, but all in all the story just felt rushed. I expected a vast world to unfold and visit many locations and many more quirky characters.

But all felt restricted and small. There was no sense of observing something truly remarkable to happen. There were just a small number of story set pieces occurring over and over again. Every location just was used very briefly to drive the plot to its quite unsatisfactory solution. Of course, it’s a dark dystopian game, but the dread and hopelessness accompanying V through Night City was just ... unpleasant. There was a constant sense of urgency and impending misery, which made the journey just feel ... I can’t put my finger on it. Maybe sprinkling in some positive vibes or hopeful plot devices could have enhanced the experience tremendously.

The game just left a bitter taste in my mouth. Hardly tackling with the motives of human enhancement, corporate dystopias and futurism, which were almost expected by me, was quite a disappointment. Combining it with the downright depressing experience of my ending. My journey was finished, but it all seemed hardly successful and satisfying. 

Technical side short: The game looks truly gorgeous most of the time - especially with raytracing enabled. Optimizations on the other hand. I mean my rig is hardly 8 months old but struggles to crank out a decent framerate. Bummer.
Bugs, glitches, errors all over the place. Even had to load a save game because progression was impossible.
The game systems like sneaking, crafting and hacking seemed janky and hardly made fun. Talents and most of the mods were boring and sometimes plain useless. Sneaking in Deus Ex was way better in my opinion...

To conclude, it was a solid experience, which sadly left many hopes unfulfilled. So, I just recommend it to gamers who have a soft spot for cyberpunk. Hopefully the DLCs are going to be just as good as the Witcher’s …

"[b]TL;DR:[/b] Bugs. Lots. If you don't mind, then the story and gameplay are great. If you [i]do[/i] mind, then wait for patches to fix them. I couldn't wait, but I don't mind much.

Yes, there are a lot of bugs. But let's break em down into three categories:

[b]1. Immersion-Breaking Bugs[/b]

NPCs T-pose and walk through walls, a low-LoD model drives past and suddenly snaps to high-LoD, and various other wacky bug antics. These happen [i]very[/i] frequently, and there's a fair chance that you're going to get one during an important, otherwise-serious cutscene.

If you can't laugh off something like this, then wait. Watch for patch notes.

[b]2. Game-Breaking Bugs[/b]

Eg: Your objective is to ""follow Jackie"" but he just walked through a door that didn't open, or he phased out of existence entirely. You're now trapped or cannot otherwise progress the main quest. While these aren't particularly frequent, it's virtually guaranteed that you're going to encounter one.

HOWEVER, the game seem to auto-save quite frequently and chances are you're only going to have lost a few minutes of gameplay. Again, if you're not prepared to tolerate this, wait and watch for patch notes.

[b]3. Performance[/b]

This game is [i]stunning[/i]. However there is a high cost to actually render it. The ""high"" defaults that the game launched with certainly looked outstanding, but the framerate was between 20 and 30 fps. Unless you have a [i]very[/i] beefy machine with something like an RTX 30XX card, you're going to be looking at the mid-to-lower end of the settings range.

Don't get me wrong, the game still looks pretty great on medium settings. Do yourself a favour and and Google ""Cyberpunk 2077"" along with your video card model and chances are someone's posted a video of what you can expect.

While I hope that CDPR will patch in some performance tweaks it's probably going to be more along the lines of avoiding framerate drops, not magically letting anything short a box full of 3090s run the game in 4k on Ultra.

[b]Tips[/b]

- LoD pop-in was pretty bad for me until I moved the game over to my SSD where it's nearly much non-existent. There's probably a patch in the pipe to address this, but YMMV.
- No matter what machine you're running right now, this game is going to push it to the limit. Consider shutting down background applications and you can squeeze out a few more FPS. [protip: Chrome and Firefox are using your GPU a little bit, even running in the background]

[b]Verdict[/b]

I try keep my expectations reasonable and not to buy into pre-release hype, but this game just seemed so damned interesting, [i]and it is[/i]. Before I bought it I asked some friends who had already put a number of hours into the game and the worst review that they gave me was ""wait until they apply a couple patches"".

Spoiler: I couldn't wait, and I don't really regret it.

The game looks amazing, the story and setting are engaging, and the gameplay is currently tantalizing me with brief glimpses of the deep end of complexity on offer for the various skill trees, upgrade paths, and crafting options.

- The game has been out for 4 days, I've played for 2 of those, and I'm just barely out into the ""main"" game.

"Probably the best single player game I've played in a while. So much content, the city is gorgeous and well designed, the city is huge but doesn't feel empty like other open world games. Driving through the city is exhilarating and handles well. Voice acting is great, all the characters even the minor ones you hear for a minute are amazing. Lot of dialogue options too that depend on your stats and choices. Combat is a lot of fun, especially the stealth and nonlethal options. 
Overall very well-designed game with minor bugs, and I'm barely halfway through the game.

Edit - And now that I've beaten the game, I am not disappointed. Amazing story, great characters. Definitely one of the best RPGs in a long time.",True
"CP2077 tries to be a bit of everything, but ends up being little of anything. The huge city backdrop is sterile, conversations are boring, the early stage gun mechanics are beyond abysmal (so many head shots needed to take down an enemy), the hacking tech is irritating, and the inventory and upgrade systems are opaque;  the main character's movement is permanent running and seems incapable of stealth; the saved game slot system is poor; and the central story seems devoid of any real purpose or value.  When the CP2077 project launched 8 years ago, there was already Deus Ex, Metro, GTA and Fallout - excellent games with a focus on interactivity, strong stories, good gameplay, tension and character development.  But 15 hours into CP2077 and I see little of any of that. It's too much like GTA but without it's fun content.

Addendum: after the rant above, I spent another long night on the game, and it actually started to improve. My tip here: leave the big oaf Jackie waiting for you, and go do some missions on your own for a while. This helps to level up weapons and a few skill points.  Best way I found to do this is to do a few 'police missions'. Here, play a cautious killer style (if you've played Far Cry, then treat it like attacking outposts). Loot bodies for better weapons. Oh, and try the Katana sword. It's good for stealth kills, especially is you level up on 'blade' skills. In a police mission in the north of NC you also pick up a sniper rifle which deals reasonable damage.  Hope this helps.",False
"Cyberpunk is a great game and is well worth the buy...
 The city style is nice and feels bigger than it is.. but even tho the overall size isnt that big its good enough.. 
The main and sub missions are good and have a great story to them. so far i've gotten 70hrs in the game and about 30hrs away from 100% of game complete.. the little filler missions are  ok but could of had more variety as they do get stale... 

The driving is about if not better than expected but still could of used some more work.
the car designs are great looks and sounding awesome.  but like said before handling is off and needs tweaked. 

fps combat is good and reminds me of titanfall a little... fist combat is crap but swords make up for it 

The character customisation is awesome. but i find purple pubes pointless and they dont dazzle my enemy not even turn em on. 

Overall i rate this game at a 9/10
 Yes there are a quite a few bugs and some do effect some missions but nothing yet hasnt been fixed by reloading the game 

i run the game on a 8700k and 1080ti on high settings and get 60 to 70 fps with little to no dips. the game is installed on a cheap hdd and i have no load time really.. even tho they say to install on ssd ive had no issue with load times in fact it loads faster than star citizen thats on my m.2

"Review after first 50 hours

[b][u] Delay Your Purchase  [/u] [/b]

After 7 years of waiting for this game, it finally arrived. To the surprise of many though, it didn't arrive in the best condition. For anyone that was following CDPR for their last releases this wouldn't have been surprising at all. All the previous Witcher games released in a bad technical and very unpolished state. But as we can see with The Witcher 3, they managed to iron out the kinks and deliver one of the best games of this generation. I firmly believe we are going to see a similar development with Cyberpunk 2077. First up, let's take a look at what makes this game good, and then  what makes it such a frustrating experience for people that awaited a perfect game.

+ Great graphics: This game can produce some of the most impressive and scenic graphics in the industry, 
    rivalling titles like Red Dead Redemption 2. Especially if you can turn on raytracing features the game can 
    look incredible.
+ Story: The story is expertly crafted, the dialogs are interesting and though provoking, characters 
    are multilayered and feel very real for game characters, the themes the Cyberpunk genre is famous for are 
    thoroughly explored while also offering new perspectives on the dystopic future.
+ Quests: While they are often carried by the amazing writing, the quests in this game are still some of the 
   best in the industry especially considering the size of this game. Each bigger quest feels handmade and has 
   lots of effort put into it to deliver a small story with interesting gameplay. While they can sometimes get 
   slightly repetetive gameplay wise, the story makes you overlook this issue easily. 
+ Music: The music is very well made and very varied, featuring songs from many different genres and artists. 
   They fit the setting very well and can help immersion a lot.
+ World: This has to be one of the best looking and most detailed game worlds ever. The city is huge and 
   perfectly captures the Cyberpunk aesthetic. Nothing seems copy pasted, every corner of the map is 
   detailed and has lots and lots of character. You can spend hours just walking around the city taking in all 
   the work that has flown into it.

RPG Mechanics: Don't go in this game expecting a ""hardcore"" rpg like Kingdom Come Deliverance or a Larian 
                           Game. I would describe this game as an rpg lite action adventure game more akin to games 
                           like Fallout 4. It feels a lot like a mixture between Fallout, The Witcher, GTA, Watchdogs and 
                           Deus Ex. Sadly the game is somewhat lacking in rpg mechanics. Looking at the gameplay: 
                           Skills are often just numerical improvements offering very little motivation beyond an easier 
                           experience to level up and skill. The slews of armor and weapons that get thrown at you feel 
                           very lacking, the only difference is a bit higher stat and maybe a couple mods but that's it. 
                           There's not really specific gear for what class you're trying to play. Now that I mentioned 
                           classes, this is easily one of the biggest negative points here. Initially the game was 
                           supposed to have 3 classes, which is already a huge step down from the original Cyberpunk 
                           pen&paper. During development they decided to scrap another class leaving us with two 
                           choices, stealth or not stealth, that's about it. Sure you can choose what weapons and skill 
                           to use but that barely changes the gameplay. This plays into the larger issue of lack of ROLE 
                           PLAYING. In The Witcher 3 you were role playing AS a character, which is fine and worked 
                           really well. When CDPR deciced to let use customize our character and based the game on a 
                           pen&paper rpg with Cyberpunk 2077 though, this really isn't a good thing. Lifepaths boil 
                           down to giving you one dialogue option that usually doesn't influence much. There's not 
                           much choice in dialogue that allows you to roleplay as a corpo for example. Even though you 
                           are supposed to have been a player in the corpo game living a high class live. You still talk 
                           and behave like a street kid no matter what. The role you are given as a player is that of a 
                           street kid, tough guy mercenary type with no option to really deviate from that role. This 
                           game would have probably been better off without a voiced main character allowing for 
                           more role playing in dialogue. 
- Technical State: The game runs badly in any sense of the word. Optimisation is lackluster, the game barely 
                             utilises both gpu and cpu resulting in very bad framerates in certain areas. The community 
                             had to figure out that CDPR didn't bother to use all cores on amd cpus. I'm expecting for 
                             more and more mistakes like this to show up over time. It's not acceptable for this game to 
                             run under 60fps on pcs that are worth thousands of euros.
                             The bugs are even worse. No 5 minutes pass by without some major bug occuring. 
                             Anything from pop in issues (despite being installed on a high end samsung ssd) to a 
                             nimation problems, to physics problems. The game is riddled with bigger and smaller bugs 
                             that really pull you out of the immersion. It feels like playing a Bethesda game without 
                             community fixes.

- AI: Easily one of the worst points of the game. The AI is quite frankly said dogshit. Games from 20 yearsago 
        had better AI than this. Cars don't actually seem to have an AI, they simply drive on predetermined 
        routes, knowing no interaction with the world besides stopping and driving. NPCs on the streets simply 
        walk around, to only dissapear or pop up as a different looking character plain the players sight. When 
        you shoot a gun in public and do a 360, all NPCs are gone all of sudden. Other times they just cower on 
        the ground for minutes in a hundred meter radius because you lightly touched the sidewalk with your 
        wheel. Early GTA games had better AI than this. This is generations behind 7 year old games like GTAV, 
        and light years behind games like RDR2. The AI robs so much of this games immersion and makes the 
        world feel like a facade that quickly crumbles as soon as you poke it a little.
- Interactivity: There is barely any. There are only very little shops, there are no mini games, you can't sit 
                        down  on a bench and relax, you can't customize your character beyond clothing, you can't sit 
                        down at a restaurant or food stall and eat. It feels insanely restrictive and makes you painfully 
                        aware that the game world is not real. 

[u][b]Verdict:[/b][/u]
This game is very clearly unfinished and was pushed out way too early. It probably needed at least another full year of development. While many aspects and the foundation of the game are simply put amazing, the unfinished and unpolished nature of the game holds it back greatly.

"Great game, great story, great world. Buggy and lots of performance issues, even for those running high end PCs. You could tell that the devs were pushed hard to release this in time for the COVID holiday season where everyone is looking for something to kill time.

"Here is my little review regarding Cyberpunk 2077
So far I have a little over 20h of playtime and I don’t think I’m even halfway through the story. First I would like to express my constructive opinion and then I will talk some “facts” (positive and negative).

Personally, I think the game is great and has earned a place as one of my favorite games. The story (so far) is great and I think it’s a great amount of shooting and action as well as easy conversation, finding things and “quiet” situations. Luckily I had a very good gaming experience and that though I play on the RX570, Ryzen 7 1700x and one goddamn hard drive (yes hard drive and not ssd). Other than really small graphics bugs, so far I haven't come across anything that would ruin / spoil the game for me.

Here are a few more facts to help you decide:
- the game was overhyped (sorry but its true)
- in the current state (at least at the release time) the game works differently on each system (different components = different bugs)
- The driving could have been a little better
- I personally like how shooting guns in this game works (most people don't)
- The main story of the game is a little shorter than expected so do side missions!
Make sure you are happy with the look of your character because I don't know why they didn't add hairdressers to the game (you can't adjust the look of the character after the creation)

Cyberpunk 2077 I personally would rate with [b]8.5 / 10[/b] the rating would be lower if I experienced bigger bugs.",True

"The environment, acting, characters, dialogue, story - all phenomenal. Unfortunately there are a vast number of game breaking bugs right now. If you're willing to reload your game over and over in certain parts, I'd say buy it in a heartbeat. Otherwise, wait a few months until they've released enough patches to smooth out the gameplay experience.",True
"TL;DR: visuals are great, story's great, music is great, FPS part of the game doesn't suck balls. Performance on launch is bad, bugs are frequent, crashes are less frequent. You can buy, provided you've a decent PC on your hands and don't mind waiting for patches.

Pros: 

1) Very authentic and striking visuals. Design of the world and NPCs is very thoroughly executed, and in my opinion, it rivals that of Witcher, Watch_Dogs and GTA5. Visually, it's like Judge Dredd meets GTA meets Deus Ex. The game doesn't look revolutionary, but it does look great -- with or without raytracing.

2) Story. No spoilers here, but it's captivating and properly driven. 

3) Soundtrack is nice as well, both original tracks and licensed music.

4) Coherent mix of RPG and FPS. I can't say that FPS part of the thing is THAT great, but it's quite passable. Skill tree is complicated at first and second glance, but allows to fine-tune your persona and characteristics very precise. Quickhacks, mini-games and everything else just falls into the mix.

Cons:

1) Optimization (or, rather lack of). Performance on Ryzen 5 3600, 8 gig RTX 2060 Super and 16 gigs of RAM is barely passable in 2560x1080 with a mix of medium-max settings with raytracing enabled on the medium quality tier. Expect 30-35 fps on average, with frequent dips into the low 20's. One would think that with disabled raytracing things would be better -- but not by that much. I still can't squeeze a solid 60 with the same settings in the same res, minus the rays.

Also, be ready for LOD glitches: low-poly models of cars, NPCs, low-res normal maps. This is really annoying at times.

2) Bugs. There are a lot of them -- but no story-breaking ones, as far as I'm aware. Expect occasional crashes of the game, floating cigarrets, glasses, NPCs falling out of outer space and falling under the floor, that kind of thing. On rare occasions, voice lines for the NPCs are also missing, but that's fixable by re-loading the saved game from earlier.

Overall, it's a great game to lose yourself in for yet another 60 hours. Was it worth it, to wait seven years for it? Probably, but conditions apply -- and make sure that you've upgraded your PC.",True
Easily the best game ever made up to this point. Keep in mind its an RPG above all else. (P.S. I didn't really pay any attention to pre-launch media so experiencing it with minimal expectations has left me incredibly happy. I've had minimal issues and with 350 hours over 4 characters have spent at most 30 minutes fiddling with settings that didn't quite run right or rerunning a portion of the game due to a crash. with auto saves every 5 minutes and about 4 crashes total its really not been a big deal. Y'all remember Skyrim?!? couldn't even get out of the intro without the wagon GOING F***ING CRAZY.) This game is the best and I'm very grateful to CDPR and hope that all the hate and ignorance doesn't cause a masterpiece like this to burn out before its even really come in to its own.,True
"This is perfect point where giving points instead of thumbs up or down would be more useful, because game is not complete trash but has nothing with potentional and nothing with cyberpunk instead 13/10 animations and copycat ghost in the shell feeling from time to time. This game has too much of everything and too little of being something. Like you would put every type of food in bucket to a point that looses taste and looks like vomit.

I was preordering and waiting this game, and I want to be immersed but game breaks this immersion on every 2 minutes i get into.
There is police calling for help to kill bandits, you take gun and shoot one bullet in bandit, and police is after you... You enter building for a mission, you do some shooting than go to loot place, you exit that building 35 minutes after shooting stops. Half of peasants on street walks normally, half of them are in scared animation. All guys are in same fear animation, no variation...35 minutes after shooting happened
Streets feel so dead, no variation except porn commercials showed in your face on every step.
Fighting system is ridiculous and nothing revolutionary. Enemies are bullet sponges and feels like worst version of Division. My friend went for melee build, he enter 6 of them and swings sword like on cocaine and people just die = zero challenge. AI is super dumb to a point where i walk 10 meters away from them not even in a cover and take one by one with supressed sniper, they don't even realize I am there and I get all those sweet stealth points bonus XP.
Driving vehicles is ridiculous, it will feel like you are dance queen skating on ice 90% of time.
Loot is overdone to a point i have everything without doing nothing, Crafting and buying in this game is useless. I can not be without meds, grenades and have tons of scraps just from looting. And yeah good luck if you going to loot, specifically drones. You need to get specific angle to pickup loot, it is often stuck in ground or behind some cover, and you can not loot small drones. 
Main story is ok-ish, nothing revolutionary,
graphics is polished beyond needed point, 
animations are probably best thing in game tho it is clearly copycat of ghost in the shell,
open world and side missions are dull asf, nothing than rince and repeat boring stuff,
Design of world is not actually cyberpunk, because neon signs and weird looking buildings are not what is defining it, same like whole game .. to much of everything so it looses it's identity. Looks futuristic but not cyberpunk.
You have hacking and outside of mission you can not do anything with it, your interaction with world boils down to zero. Feels so empty and scripted.
Romances and interaction with mission characters are so empty and scripted. For romance you need to click 1 of two given answers, click every time correct one and you will get it, no flirting, no getting to it.. just clicking on pre-scripted path. Enemies running through walls, glitching in mountains.. Like enemies spawn in zone it T pose and stay like that while i click their heads.. so f-in challenging and interesting, right? cars dropping through roads, you hitting invisible walls while riding, people on street stuck in fear animation randomly... world feels so broken, and breaks every 2 minutes.

Everyhing in this game feels very scripted and has nothing to do with sandbox. They could learn a lot from GTA series.
9 years of developement?
so many delays?
for this price is not a worth buy guys.

It is not a bad game, you can waste some time in it.
Is it something new and revolutionary? not even close to it.
My first 9 hours were like: wooooaaa... but after 20 i realized how much scripted woooaaa element is.. Now after 35 hours I am struggling to go further and continue because it feels like total waste of time. Nothing to explore and discover because everything is marked on map and go from point A to point B style, Hacking chip was fun in one mission on beginning, but is same and not challenging everytime later.

This is great example of totally wasted potentional. on 60% discount or more could be ok to buy and kill some time. Otherwise thumbs down boiiis.
And no, they will not fix it with time, because those are not bugs on surface, it is just poorly designed game.",False
"Just finished the game clocking in at almost 40 hours. That was main story plus majority of the major side jobs. 

Despite all of the bugs/glitches, mediocre UI, and poor AI this game has, I absolutely LOVED playing through it. If you are somebody who can look past technical issues and can sit back and enjoy a good story with great characters and an even better world then I would definitely recommend this game. There's very few games that can make me feel like I actually miss the characters and world after i finish it, and this is one of them. This game is no doubt one of the highlights in gaming this year for me, and personally, I think it was worth the wait.

I would give this game a solid 8.5/10. It's not a 10/10 because of the technical and AI issues, but honestly they were not as bad as everyone is making them out to be given how great the rest of the game was. That being said, the PC version is a lot less buggy than the console versions - I only ran into 2 maybe 3 game breaking bugs and the rest were minor (and actually enhanced the experience because of how comical they were). 

[b]The Good:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]World:[/b] CDPR did an absolutely amazing job with the worldbuilding in this game. It's incredibly deep, immersive, and really grabs you into it from the get-go. Night City completed exceeded my expectations.
[*][b]Characters:[/b] Almost every single character is interesting and diverse in their own way - even side NPCs. Character development is top notch as well, and you can easily see some key characters transform throughout the game. 
[*][b]Story:[/b] The story was way better than I was expecting. It was a good ride all throughout and complimented the rest of the game very well. There's a handful of endings as well including some secret ones.
[*][b]Voice Acting:[/b] This game has some of the best voice acting I have EVER heard. Shoutout female V's voice actor. Definitely a strong point of the game and enhances the story tenfold. 
[*][b]Music:[/b] The music matches the game incredibly well, whether you're driving freely in the city, fighting a cyberpsycho in the streets, or in a heated story moment.
[*][b]Animations:[/b] The motion capture animations were some of the best I have ever seen yet in a video game. Especially for the main story missions. The facial expressions were decent too with some outliers. 
[/list]
[b]The Bad:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Bugs/Glitches:[/b] Obviously this is probably the biggest issue with the game. The PC version is not as buggy as the console versions however they are still present and should not go ignored. I did not encounter many game-breaking bugs in my play through however, whether that just be pure luck or maybe it runs better on my hardware than others, IDK.
[*][b]AI:[/b] The AI in this game is not great. It will have moments that will frustrate you, but overall it's not the end of the world and will sometimes even make you laugh.
[*][b]UI:[/b] The UI is ... alright. Navigating the inventory and weapons is okay enough - the issue starts to appear when you need to read shards/messages for quest objectives. The shards and messages menu is truly, truly awful.
[*][b]Combat/Bossfights:[/b] The combat in this game is mediocre at best. It's fun, but not challenging at all. Increasing difficulty makes enemies bullet spongy and you made of glass. Boss fights are a joke, you can walk circles around them and never get hit. 
[*][b]Braindances:[/b] Probably my least favorite part of the game. These were almost never fun for me and I was unable to find myself ever enjoying them as they were intended. It's a cool concept but for me it was just not enjoyable. Maybe some others will find some fun in it though?
[/list]
All in all I enjoyed this game immensely, and will definitely be revisiting this game again for another playthrough in the future. I can understand why majority of the gaming community is not happy with this game currently, especially console players who seem to not be able to play it at all right now due to bugs, but I think the hate is a bit unjustified (at least on PC) if you are in it for the right reasons.",True
It was worth the wait,True
"Boy, I really do not know where to start with this one. I do not do many reviews but this game was so disappointing that I’d like to give my two cents. The main story felt like it was rushed and lots of stuff was cut from it. It felt like half of the time I spent progressing the main story was the prologue and the other 3/8 of it was the final mission. I had no idea I was even on the final mission until the “This is the point of no return” box popped out as I was about to enter the building. 

They introduced all these factions that would have been cool to play as/or have side quests with but there was ZERO interaction with the upper echelons. You just get told “oh hey yea these are all the factions in night city aaaand that’s it, game’s over” not once was I meddling with gang affairs or corpo shenanigans. I chose the corpo life path and after the initial sequence and a certain side quest(where you just go to a certain location, talk to a NPC that you first met in the initial sequence and then the quest is completed) there was no semblance of my previous line of work. Every now and then the game reminds you that you were once a corpo with the dialogue options but it really didn’t mean anything. I only chose those dialogue options due to them being unique and not because I had any idea what being a corpo was like. Sometimes V would have dialogue options that would sympathise/be cynical as he knew how it was like being an ex-corpo and in my mind I’d be like “hell if I know, I didn’t even get to experience any of it.” If the game told me midway that I’d started off as a street rat, hell, I’d believe them. 

Cyberware feel like perks and not an extension of oneself; most of the enhancements are just stat boosts and does not alter gameplay whatsoever. It really feels like you’re as much of an advanced superhuman cyborg as Geralt is a baker, taking on odd jobs killing monsters to fund his bakery franchise dream. They could have done more with this as the cybernetic enhancements were pretty much the main selling point of this game but alas, they decided to make it as barebones as possible. Also, a lot of the legendary upgrades that affected gameplay required you to reach a certain attribute point threshold and most had to have that certain attribute close to being maxed before being able to purchase it. In a single playthrough, you could probably have two attributes maxed out and that’s only if you heavily invest into those attributes without putting points into anything else. 

95% of the enemies you face in Cyberpunk 2077 are your typical 2018 humans sporting 2005 AI. Half of the time they’re crouching behind objects with their head still visible and the other half they’re running for their lives, clipping into objects. Occasionally you will encounter ACTUAL cybernetically enhanced individuals but those are few and far between. Quick hacks are also under utilised by enemies with it mostly being exclusive to net runners and just like cybernetically enhanced humans, you almost never encounter them. The same can also be said for drones , turrets and mechs,  making quickhack perks that apply to these types of enemies redundant. I invested points into such perks, thinking that I’d face more of such enemies as I progressed through the main story due to the nature of the faction I was up against but little did I know I was already in the final act of the story and even then, they were nowhere to be seen. 

And of course, I’ve to mention the plethora of bugs that come with this game. It is abundantly clear that CDPR decided to release this game in an unfinished state. I’ve had my fair share of buggy games; The Glitcher series, Skyrim, fallout 76, AC unity just to name a few but none can hold a candle to Cyberpunk 2077. NPCs would clip through objects, T pose and spaz out. Quests would hang if you do not complete them in a certain order, forcing you to reload your save file. Emotional cutscenes would be ruined by characters sliding around, teleporting or clipping. There are just a multitude of bugs that are gamebreaking and often ruins the immersion.

Even though I’ve many gripes about this game, it wasn’t all doom and gloom. The side characters were very well written and not just one dimensional, making the side quests with them very enjoyable to play. They were all very relatable and you could understand their intentions, motivations and frustrations. Johnny silverhand was also very well integrated into the story and side quests, often acting as the devil on your shoulder, making you question your decisions. He really felt like an extension of V and not just some random guy that pops up whenever it’s convenient for him to do so. 

Overall, I wouldn’t recommend this game to anyone as it currently is. The game is beautiful with compelling characters but those alone do not justify the 60 dollars price tag. CDPR could have done a lot more with the combat, worldbuilding and the pacing of the story. Sad to say but Cyberpunk 2077 would be something Ubisoft would publish as a sequel to watchdog legions set 30 years into the future under a strict 1 year deadline.",False
"TLDR At the Bottom.

A Rollercoaster of Emotions.

That is one of many ways that I could describe this game. From the hilarious and joyful moments that I received from some quests to the frustrations and disappointment of the amount of bugs in this game made this game a definite unforgettable experience.

The writing in this game is one of the best that I have ever seen. The situations and the characters in this game feel grounded, they feel like they could exist if we were to stray to a darker path with our world. The ending that I got made me so satisfied with all the hard work and effort that I put into this game that I started heavily tearing up, borderline crying.

But the side quests carry the same, if not more importance than the main questline. If you're a person to sprint through the main quests without batting an eye on the side quests - the game is not for you. 

The shooting and the driving is serviceable. The shooting and looting follows the same formula that we have seen in previous games like Borderlands or Destiny to some extent. Simple mods like sights and muzzle devices are a small additions that could make a gun pleasant to use.

The driving could use a bit of work. It's not the worst thing in the game and the different car variations definitely change up the feel of the vehicle. With my poor ass pc only being able to get 30-40 frames it made the driving in the city not the most pleasant experience. Again, possible and servicable, but could use a bit of fine tuning.

The economy, looting and crafting definitely need to get an overhaul. With the little amount of money that you get from gigs or side quests, even main quests, its often difficult to buy such things like new cyberware and cars. High-end weaponry costs too much and are rarely worth the price. The crafting is busted, with epic items requiring legendary components, it almost feels like crafting is borderline useless, because you can and will find better weaponry in the world.

The bugs: I encountered a good chunk of them, but none of them were gamebreaking or stopped me from progressing a questline. The bugs varied differently, like floating cigarettes in a cutscene, npc's popping into existence in front of my eyes to just wrongly placed objective markers and no clue as to where you are supposed to go next. I truly believed that the game needed an another delay, but the amount of hate and disapproval that CDPR would've received was to be massive.

TLDR: The things that the game does right like shooting, the world and story make this game worth the 60 pieces of your favourite currency. But things such as economy and the bugs need fixing, as they are the only things that are bringing this game down.

9/10 truly wish that it were longer.",True
"It's almost exactly what I expected. 
GTA meets Deus-ex with an interesting storyline.",True
"Look, don't get me wrong  [b] i love this game [/b], been playing it non stop since release. But there are a lot of glaring issues with the game i've been noticing while playing through. One. - The wanted system. Cops appear 5 feet infront of you the moment you get a wanted level and are incapable of driving a ****ing car, so no cop car chases.

Two. A lot of the random bits of loot you can find around the city are unlootable. It shows the interactable icon but you can't pick it up. Two such items are right outside your apartment.  Can sometimes happened to dropped guns.

Three. There seems to be a memory leak issue with the game. Don't need to explain this bit because everyone knows what it means when this happens...

Four. (not too harsh of a spoiler but doing it just encase) [spoiler] There's a point in the game when you have to infiltrate a facility to upload a virus to a blimp. One of the choices to get inside said facility is to steal a Ahsoka van and just drive right in. Was expecting there to be ""no tresspass areas"" but you have full access to the WHOLE FACILITY. Full access to every security room, to every terminal/security terminal. EVERYWHERE. You could be bu**fu**ing the walking mech outside and no one would be batting a eye. [/spoiler]

Minor sh** (But some of these can be fixed with mods)
No walking key for K+M but they're working on adding it.
Dodge key is assigned to double tapping the movement keys and THERES NO WAY TO CHANGE IT. Imagine sneaking and you accidentally hit the W key twice and you dodge right into the enemy you were just trying to kill. IT HAPPENS MORE OFTEN THEN YOU WOULD THINK.
Big spoiler ------->[spoiler] During the Jackie death scene, his gun got stuck in his hand and you can imagine how this would look while he pulled a card out of his head and put it into yours  [/spoiler]
The preview display window that shows items in the bottom right corner will sometimes reshow the item you just looted when looking at other *EMPTY* dead bodies.

I'm writing this in the small chance it'll help to improve the game. I wasn't behind the hype of this game, i wasn't a big fan of witcher 3 either but for a open world game, i enjoyed it. Half baked but feels *different* after the cookie cutter bull**** thats been released the past few years.

To everyone complaining about bulletspongey-ness. ITS A RPG FIRST AND A FIRST PERSON SHOOTER SECOND FFS. Even on very hard you can kill enemies relatively quick (almost too quick tbh). If you could one shot everyone (which you can with the right build and weapons) the game would be a fucking snore. 

PS I think Johnny Sliverhand is one of the many things that ruined this game. Felt like they had another story planned out and then they ham fisted Keanu Reeves in as a main character half way through development.",False

"The police in this game are the most poorly designed police I’ve ever played in a video game in my life and I’m not exaggerating.
Discussion
You thought GTA police or some other game were bad where they would just show up whenever you murder somebody and know your exact position? Oh no no no. I’d even say Skyrim guards have almost better AI. Where do I even begin with cyberpunk police.

First off what triggers them? You would guess that they come after you kill enough people and then it maybe takes them like 30 seconds to roll up in cars to kill you right? No. If you kill one person, they immediately spawn in front of you out of thin air and start multiplying. The more you kill the harder it is and the game always surrounds you in cops so it’s almost impossible to survive if too many spawn. I have no words for how poorly this was designed. Oh and btw if you are aiming at civilians, cops also have the chance to spawn on you from that as well. Even if you are shooting at gang members and a civilian happens to be in your crosshairs, the cops don’t give a shit. They will go “woah buddy. You gunning down a gang? Good. AIMING AT A CIVILIAN?! THATS ILLEGAL!”

Secondly the 1-5 star cop thing is a complete joke. It only matters in terms of cop numbers not wanted level. All you have to do is drive down the street and you lose them anyways so what’s the point? Even running from them immediately loses them. They don’t even bother to chase you unless you are within 20 meters of them. They don’t even chase you in cars. In fact, I have never seen a single police officer driving a car. The most I’ve seen is them parked on the side of the road. I don’t even think enemies in the open world drive cars besides in the missions and that’s really sad. I don’t care if the driving enemy AI is so bad that they drive off road and crash into walls. At least have driving enemy AI in the game. Like come on. How can a game from like 2008 have driving enemy AI but an open world game in 2020 doesn’t? This is unacceptable.

Thirdly if you lose the cops, they immediately despawn. In other games, you would lose them and then they would still be patrolling the surrounding area maybe looking for where you went or lingering. Nope. Not in this game. The completely vanish making it very easy to steal cop cars.

Nothing is interactable. There are no activities you can do to experience the culture of a dystopian city, Cyberpunk culture, or just a city in general. You cannot even alter your cosmetics, in a setting where cosmetic enhancement and fashion are integral. Not even a tattoo or haircut.

You shop for cars via receiving random texts from NPCs. You can't go to the bar and have a drink. NPC AI is atrocious. No AI is capable of anything beyond their scripted events. A guy is banging on a vending machine for eating his money, you hack it so it despenses all the food, and he continues to bang on the vending machine. Cops spawn out of nowhere and then despawn if you crouch in a corner for long enough. ""Random assaults"" are just a small group of gangsters standing over 1 dead guy. Arcade machines are everywhere but you cannot play them. Cars follow 1 scripted path and just stop working altogether if you park in front of them, and then when you turn away, they disappear and are replaced with a different car.
 
Nothing in this world is believable, and exploring the city is empty and shallow. You never feel like the world would continue living without you, you feel as if they'd despawn when you leave. These are issues that aren't going to be fixed by patches. These are issues that will hold the game back from being great forever.

If I walk in the city, 99% of people are just standing still. I cannot interact with any shops and if I punch somebody, every NPC in a 30-meter radius reacts exactly the same (crouching).

The entire traffic just stopped altogether when one car blocked the road. And not a single NPC tried to reverse and go another route. They just sit in their car waiting for the car in front of them to move, while the car in front of them was waiting for the car in front of them to move and so on. In literally every other open world game that has cars, they try to find another way trough if something's blocking the road. In Cyberpunk, they're given a single pattern they're supposed to drive through, and if something comes on their way, they stop until the object is gone. The AI is quite literally non existent. I've read stories from countless people who've helped NPC's by killing gang members attacking them but the NPC's just stay on the ground scared even though the danger is gone.

The trailers and dev talk made it seem like Night City is a place where random encounters are a common thing and there are a lot of fun things to do everywhere in the city. Am i blind or what? So far i have found a couple of soda machines that i can suprisingly interact with. I still can't use arcade machines tho.

They had an entire team dedicated for the open world aspect of the game. What where they doing this entire time? Animating the one dude kicking the damn vending machine that didn't work, and proceeding to keep kicking it even after i hacked it to work again? I swear to god, if the visual offering wasn't as sensational as it is in the game, the game would feel like a 15 years old open world. Currently it feels like that too, but just a HD Remastered   one (If you have the RTX 3090 to handle above medium settings). There is nothing to do besides the quests in the world whatsoever. I can't remember the username of the person on Reddit who said this genius line; ""Nigh City is like an astonishing looking loading screen for whenever you're switching between missions."" CDPR truly lied to their playerbase about what the game would be like.

No driving AI, tbh no AI whatsoever for any NPC's outside main characters. No ability to change appearance of your character. No life or interaction in the actual game world. May as well take the police out of the game as they're pointless. NPC's all walking scripted paths repeating the same five sassy remarks over and over.

Let's compare these statements to what is in the game at launch:
-No NPC Day/Night cycle. NPCs spawn and despawn outside of the player's view.
-If an NPC is doing an action, they will do that action forever until the player moves.
-NPCs that are not story/side quest related have one dialog reply.
-If one NPC is assaulted, every other NPC in a large circle around the player will crouch to the floor in the same animation, even if they did not see the original assault.
-NPCs in a car will follow a specific route. If the route is even slightly interupted, for example by your car, they will cease to move forever until you remove the obstruction.
-NPCs in a car will not attempt to move or exit their vehicle if you assault them with bullets/another vehicle.
-NPCs will not acknowledge the player if they run the player over with their car.
-NPCs will not attempt to steal their vehicle back if you steal it from them.
-NPCs will not attack you or defend themselves in any way or form, even if engaged upon with just fists.
-Police spawn around the player's vision when the player is wanted, forever, until they attempt to hide or drive away.
-Police to not attempt to question, warn, or arrest the player for even the smallest crime commited, for example if you bump into them or accidently enter a private area.
-Police are incapable of driving cars and chasing the player if they drive away.
-Police will not attack hostile targets like Gangs if they are not already doing so in an activity.
-Police will know if the player has attacked an NPC in the middle of the badlands and spawn next to the player, without vehicles.
-NPCs will rarely thank or acknowledge the player if they are helped by the player.
-Scripted NPCs that have dialog will say their dialog then proceed to stand there forever. They will also repeat the same dialog if the player leaves the area.",False

"This game fails to capture everything that made CDProjekt Red games great in the past (including the Witcher 3).

I would like to use this quote to best describe this game, with a catch:

""Jack of all trades, master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one""...  

I really wish this quote was applicable.... which might've been its saving grace.  The only thing mastered here is an incredible atmosphere, and unfortunately this is straight from the playbook of modern AAA gaming.  Build a beautiful environment to have mediocre interactions in.  I can look past bugs, and the stripped features (unfortunately), but ultimately what we have here is an absolutely beautiful painting  and when you step into that painting and start interacting with the components, you realize  there's not much there.  It's a shell of great ideas and I think that's where it will stay for at least a year or more.  If it does change for the better (which mind you, CDProjekt Red IS in fact known for), I will change my review.  I also plan on finishing this game (it feels like a slog at the moment) and will change my review if it gets better.

The gameplay itself feels lacking.  They abandoned a majority of RPG elements such as detailed secondary quests, making choices (in the secondary quests even), multiple branching dialogue options, the ability to say yes, or no to certain things (even the quests themselves).  This is an action/stealth game disguised as an RPG that doesn't do action, nor stealth particularly well.  The enemies are bullet sponges and it feels like you're playing budget borderlands.  The stealth feels like something pre splinter cell chaos theory.  I'm thinking early early 2000's game mechanics or even older.  The enemies are either clueless, or all know exactly where you are.  I would say lazy programming, I've heard the argument for lore based explanations on this (including being on the 'network' and that's fine, but that doesn't mean it's fun.  I will say, a lot of the guns, abilities, and upgrades ARE cool.  Really cool. 

Lastly, I can't help compare this to the Witcher 3.  What I really expected from this game was an RPG that had a lot of the elements of the Witcher 3 that made it great.  However ...
there's no baby you have to decide last minute to throw into an oven to trick an evil ghost... 
there's no tree with a spirit that you have to decide to release after a multi tiered quest that sent you on an investigation into a swamp haunted by witches...  
there's no beasts that you can hunt, and discover they are just misunderstood or kind and reason with to prevent them from murdering innocents...  There is none of this.  What I mean by ""this"" is multi-tiered well crafted stories.  And you may be saying to yourself ""well, of course not! this is a sci-fi universe about how everything sucks and capitalism is rampant, it's supposed to be simple!"".  I'm going to be straight with you... is it simple, should it be?  There's a lot of cool ideas that can be executed within this universe... it is basically future fantasy, which is in the same veins of creativity.  While I am not familiar with the source material of cyberpunk, I am struggling to believe someone couldn't have thought of more than a majority of the gameplay being sci-fi oriented fetch quests and could've put a little heart into it.  It's really disappointing.

So it comes down to this, this is what I think this game is at the moment.  This is a fetch quest action game that was an open palette for some seriously incredible ideas.  Minimal creativity has been captured here and I'm assuming any of the impressive ideas are simply from the source material and nothing else.  Everything here has not just been done before... think Deus Ex, GTA, Far Cry but executed far better.  Deus ex has the complex morality around cybernetic enhancement and the feeling of a true immersive sim, GTA has an incredible feeling open world with *ahem* working AI that interacts to your actions and hilarious and entertaining missions, Far Cry has large open worlds to fuck around in that always seemed to reward going off the beaten path.  Lastly, of course the Witcher 3 (possibly one of the best RPG's I've ever played), which was the home of this exact same studio that made this game... has somehow had no influence on the development of this game other than objects, assets, and generalities like inventory (which mind you, they did a TERRIBLE job of during the launch of the witcher pre-patches).  This continues to blow my mind.

So back to my quote, about jack of all trades.  If you were going to be so ambitious, at least take from the games that do it the best, and implement the good portion of those game mechanics.  Also A+ for attempting to implement some interesting concepts (I think the hacking is cool).  However, you can mix and match whatever content you want into your game and build a beautiful looking world around it, but ultimately if the game either does not have a great story, or the gameplay itself feels stale or unfun, the end result is more like a demo than a game.  Therefore I cannot recommend it, however, it would be a beautiful piece of art to show off.",False

If you are aware of all the problems he has been having and want to buy, I advise you to wait a little while to get out the next patch, which unfortunately we can’t find out, but I hope the game will be fixed when they leave, because it has huge potential to be one of the best games ever made, but it had a sad release. I love CD Projekt Red and I have faith that they will fix the game over time. The game will provide you with hours and hours of fun, if it works well. The game still has a lot of problems, but they didn't hinder me at all until the time of this analysis.",True
"After completing the game and seeing how the story ends, Im more depressed than I usually am. No good endings, just pain. Other than that, Game is great would recommend. I personally love all things cyberpunk (Books, Films) so this game was quite a treat. Story is great, one could even say its ""breathtaking"". City Is one of the more impressive open worlds there are and is absolutely beautiful. Game world really makes you feel like you always wanted to feel in futuristic city if you watched films like Bladerunner, they did a great job at capturing feeling and of course the look of futuristic city. I think the game is not only great but is also important for gaming industry as a whole. For now when Im posting this review game suffers from good amount of bugs and is not very well optimised. Im sure CDP will fix all these issues tho, so I would get too concerned about that. Also important thing to note if you are looking to buy this game is that its NOT gta/ gta 6, this game although it may seems like its similar to gta franchise, its completely different and if you approach this game with ""oh this is like gta/ gta 6"" attitude you will absolutely not have fun in this game. Overally would definetely recommend this game to people who love futurism/ cyberpunk or are just looking for an great story that grabs your heart and an adventure in a city of future.  <3",True
"I dont understand the double Standards of the Gaming Community, this Game launched with almost as many Bugs as Fallout 76 and yet its getting praised into the Heavens as some kind of 10/10 Title.
As it currently stands this Game is in my Opinion at most a 6/10, the Story is boring the RPG Elements are barebones at best and Features that were promised/shown are either missing or badly implemented.
The Pros are the City itself if you ignore all the Bugs you encounter at every corner, aswell as the Guns that feel good to shoot and the Music is nice to listen to.

While this Game might be good in a couple of Months from now that doesnt excuse the sorry state this launched in.

TLDR: Buy this Game in a year or two when its on discount and actually bugfree.",False

The game might've been a mess when it came out but my god, the story, the soundtrack, the characters, and the world is just so damn amazing.  It's such a shame that the game didn't release properly and wasn't fully finished, it possibly could've been Game of the Year material, hell, I think it's my Game of the Year just for the story and characters alone. There's only been a few games that kept me to my seat and kept me engrossed in it as Cyberpunk 2077 did. After finishing all the side missions and finishing the story it felt so underwhelming and it made me want more, like damn that was it? I just wished that they had fully finished the game before releasing it, it could've been such a great game. Sadge.",True

"Updated review:
A labour of love. A new standard for graphics in conjunction with a neurotic attention to detail make the atmosphere of this game surreal. Stupidly great soundtrack. Very nicely acted and profound main story line.
However gameplay is quite lacking. Story was easy enough to beat on 'hard', but in general the real problem I have with this game is that regardless of how it is unfinished, glitchy, buggy, and how that will be patched over the next few weeks and months, the game just doesn't have enough mechanics.
Not only it does not have the things that are expected at this point as they have appeared in the GTA series for years now, it also does not add anything new, at all.
There was surely an expectation for this game to bring gameplay to a whole another level, but in principle this is an FPS game with some mild RPG elements, which feels more like GTA than anything else.  
The problem is that both GTA5 and RDR2 offer way more immersion and complexity, whereas in Cyberpunk 2077 there is very little that you can do besides follow the main storyline or enjoy the side quests. 
Once you're done with the scripted content, Night City feels extremely basic and far from the real world, its NPCs being lifeless bots with lazy AI, and so little to do that it's not long before a feeling of claustrophobia emerges.
I guess I was expecting this title to take gaming to a new level of complexity, as games like Skyrim and The Witcher 3 did when they came out, where as it's really stale even when you ignore the amount of bugs/glitches.

It's probably worth saying, I have played this on an RTX 2070, Ryzen 7 2700X and 32GB RAM and I had to spend half of my playing experience fiddling with graphic settings in order to decide what compromise would be best. 
In the end if you care about having a smooth playing experience (around 60fps at least) you'll have to either crank up the DLSS (and expect some blurry moments) or forget about Ray-Tracing altogether.

Whilst with high settings this game does look phenomenal, there are other titles that are comparable without requiring a £1600 GPU.

I have uninstalled Cyberpunk 2077 as soon as I finished the main storyline, I think I will give it another go a few months later, once it's been polished a bit.",True

"My rating has nothing to do with performance. 

This game really lived up to the hype, after playing for around 30 Hours now, I'm stunned. 
It is exactly what I imagined, when thinking about this game, thinking about Night City in 2077.
I think the developers and directors really put love into the whole world.
The Vibe, the Atmosphere, the Music, the Characters, the Stories. 
I wasn't disappointed by one thing yet. 

But still I have the feeling the game can offer even more, it feels like one or two Roleplaying elements might miss, like maybe having even more possibilities to interact with the world around you, because for me this game is all about immersion, but expecting that in future DLCs,

All in all, I'm happy to finally play this game and experience my adventure in Night City.
And I really recommend anyone nearly interested in RPGs, ScFi & dystopian Cyberpunk, to get this game, you wont be disappointed. (I'm not here to judge on performance)

9/10 could be 10/10, hoping they are stalling that for the DLCs.

"64 hours were put in when I finally completed all side activities with only the PROLOGUE MAIN MISSIONS beat (That you COULD beat without doing main missions to unlock more side missions). 

Hardest difficulty (LV47 & SCLV50). Enjoyed every second of it EXCEPT day 1 stability & bug issues (Which were a lot then). 1.04 stabilized the game a TON more (Playing at 4k Max graphics). Unfortunately BUGS are still here and are VERY plentiful. Around 10-14 hours into the main story as of this moment with more side gigs being completed that have been unlocked now (Bringing me to the now 80.6 hours).

I REALLY am enjoying the main story just as much as I am the side stories. Some side stories even feel exactly on par with the main stories quality rather (Where as most side activities & gigs actually feel like side content, a good amount feel more involving with great arcs even).  

SOME side stories/gigs/activities COULD be skipped but I would never do that as it adds so much to the experience, yours & other character developments, more light on the overall main story, and finally you will definitely FEEL like you KNOW Night City,

*Issues
- NEEDS quality of life additions (EX: Craft X amount of items, Store all in storage, Insert something that SHOULD have honestly been in the game at launch).
- Mini-map should either be able to be zoomed out & in or just zoomed out as the distance it covers is laughably small.
- Bugs & visual issues are literally everywhere and happen very frequently as well. (Invisible weapons, dual dialogue, no dialogue scroll, texture floating, people you call spawning to you, and the list continues VERY EXTENSIVELY MIGHT I ADD, on and on).
- MORE stabilization. Random spots also have fps dips for no apparent reason? (On 4k with MAX GRAPHICS I shouldn't have things ""popping"" into existence or becoming visible as I get within 20-30 feet of them. People/cars/textures/etc shouldn't appear in front of me and I shouldn't even have to SEE them spawn in. BIG ISSUE TO ME HERE).

Honestly. Other than the bugs & stability/visual issues the game in my OPINION is a 9/10 right now. After beating the game I will come back and add anything below. (Game would be a 10/10 as of right now if it weren't for all the issues I listed).

I VERY HIGHLY recommend getting this game.

(After completing)
- Everything I said above holds true still. A perfect game with a shit ton of bugs/issues. I got the ending I wanted, and am greatly saddened the game is over. Roughly 100 hours...And it felt too short...Can't wait until the expansions come out to continue the story. Z

Final Verdict = 9/10  *Can't give it a 10/10 because of all the issues and because the story is not complete*

Best way to play for a complete MC/Side character/World building/Overall experience. Play beginning lifepath missions --> Once you leave the apartment do EVERYTHING in Watson before starting the main missions --> Only do the main missions until the Arasaka Tower Mission is over and the world map completely opens up ---> Do ALL side activities available in the WHOLE map ---> Then do the main missions and when new side activities/gigs/etc show up do them before continuing.",True

"The game is pretty good, in all aspects. Gunplay? Pretty good. Melee? Pretty good. Driving? Pretty good. You get the gist. Many mechanics are good enough, but leave something to be desired. In a way the game reminds me of Fallout 4, which also had the same fate of being a subject of hype and turning out to be 'pretty good'. Gunplay and movement is similar in both games, I can't really explain what it is, but something feels off in both games. 
Visually the game is beautiful, which is not a surprise. Some visual glitches are apparent, but they don't hamper the gameplay much. I have only experienced a single crash, which I consider lucky given how unstable the game seems to be for some people. 
Overall I'm happy about my purchase, I feel like I have already gotten good value for my 60€, and I still have a lot of content left to experience. You can tell that the game has been produced in a timecrunch, but it is not as bad as you would expect, or as bad as some people make it out to be.",True
"My impression after playing the game for 9 hours straight:

This game is so littered with bugs its ridiculous, in the main storyline there are huge visual bugs that every person is going to see which makes me wonder did they even play their own game? even if they manage to remove the copius amount of bugs, the story and game is still super handholdy and plays more like rollercoaster then an actual game and the scanning system which is super tedious and boring. The npcs barely react and have super awkward death animations a lot of the time, I was in a main part of the story and an enemy right in front of me was just glitching in and out of existence with his voice lines cutting in and out, and in the same mission i stealth killed a guy and there was zero sound for grabbing him just complete silence and he says ""You want problems?"" and just silently dies lol. There's so much stuff like that, suitcases floating mid air whilst being solid, signs floating mid air in the street, the car controls are unsatisfying, NPC's disapear the milisecond you look away from them, visual bugs that every player is going to see that are hardbaked into the game. 
All and all the game is super railroady, the dialogue is lackluster for the most part. They nailed the combat, its fast paced, expessive and enjoyable but you barely see any of it instead you are dragged through the story just to watch shit happen rather then actually push through the events of the game, I completely understand its meant to be an rpg and not a first person shooter type game exlusively but i think if they just took most of the tedious scanning out of the game and replaced it with something that respects the players time the game would have been better. I love Cd Projekt Red but this game is just so rough.

Game plays like its from 2000's. Almost as if it was made to compete with fallout 3. But looks like michelangelo came back from the dead and went to night school for graphics design. If i could go back in time this would be game of the decade. Right now its game of the month. But id give these guys my money  every month for a game with this kind of artwork.  Its got the structure of a full fledged rpg but the depth of my 3 year olds blow up pool.  This is more like a duke nukem with cutscenes. All the level ups and gear are just  like developer ideas that could have been cut and we'd still have a  solid first person action adventure game.

"First of all, your experience may vary.
In my case game runs smooth, without game-breaking bugs. Not gonna lie, some bugs still happen but this is something that you have to be prepared if you want to enjoy this title. Just lower your expectation a notch and remember that this game is released across 2 generations of hardware - there's as much as devs can do.
This game is massive, with loads of content and many things to find. Overall, going with proper attitude will make your experience fun. This is an RPG. Keep that in mind, because of that enemies are bullet sponges, but there's no place for counter-strike like combat in this type of game. Big chunk of story is just talking - again, something that you have to expect from an RPG title.
Going back to experience - the game and world itself is pretty believable, which makes easy to really sink into it and spend looong sessions in front of your monitor. But to do it for real, games have to run smooth, in my configuration which is something like i7-10700kf/rtx3070/32gb ram/m.2 drive for the game it runs very well. I feel like fast SSD is a must to even try this game. 
Despite all minor bugs that I encounter I still feel like this game is one of the best of its kind. But trust me - this game will be as good now as it will be in a year or so.

"Awesome! 
First 5-6 hours of the main quest is heavy storyline that introduces you to Night City and its inhabitants, but after that prologue, more freedom to explore this incredible open world filled with lots of things to do.   
There's a variety of ways to complete quests, go in guns blazing, slash everything with a katana, hacking, stealth/assassinations and sometimes the way you talk to people can cause you to have alternative options or story. 
It's so replayable with how many ways you can get through a story line quest and how being a Streetkid, Corpo or Nomad can affect people around you. 
The game is also good at getting you emotionally attached or invested in characters and then offing some of them.
There's also a variety of cool outfits and weapons to play with and I love Photo mode.
The realism of the game is amazing as well, so there's so many little details like in my room there's old pizza boxes and take away boxes on the table, and theres little bugs crawling on the table and floor. Hardly noticeable but makes it feel more real. 

Plus the quests after the 'prologue' are awesome, absolutely loving the Delamain quests and there was a really funny Glados / Portal reference in one of the missions. Great quest design went into this game :D
 
This is a highly amazing RPG game with so much story, but for Action game fans, the game play is better after the 'prologue' as in the beginning your poor, but you start to unlock more things, get cool skills and are able to buy more upgrades like the Mantis Blades, or the hidden Rocket launcher built into your arm during and after it. 
 
Also if you get motion sickness from this game because your tired or haven't played an first person action game in a while, lower or turn off Additive Camera Motions, especially if you end up having an Alcoholic drink.

i did the corpo start and (SPOILERS) it is a perfect beginning for your own choice adventure after you lose everything and have to start anew. you could be introduced to the characters gradually rather than not being attached to any of them at all and have the ending of the intro sequence be the end of the game with the beloved characters getting killed in their final big job.

instead what we get is a kinda meh rpg that feels like its from 2016 with characters thrown at you straight from the get-go so you dont have a clue whats going on and who is who.

"REVIEW EDITADA EM 15/12/2020

Sinceramente esse jogo só tem a história boa e gráficos bonitos. Comprei o jogo e estou jogando, tenho umas 40 horas de jogo e sinceramente a jogabilidade é ok, nada de surpreendente, o sistema de combate é muito parecido com o do Dying Light, o handling dos veículos é um assunto delicado pois em alguns veículos é muito bom (exemplo o primeiro carro do V em Night City), mas tem outros que é simplesmente horrível de dirigir.

A IA do jogo é um pesadelo de tão ruim e boba, pedestres não fazem nada além de andar aleatoriamente pelas ruas e ocasionalmente abaixam de medo quando acontece algum combate por perto, a IA dos veículos é pior ainda com NPCs que simplesmente seguem um traçado e não se importam com o que está em sua frente, se você vier de encontro o NPC não tentará desviar e vai simplesmente andar reto até colidir com você, eles nem tentam desviar, frear, não demonstram reação. Algo parecido acontece quando você para um veículo na rua, os mesmos não ignoram o veículo e desviam pra continuar seguindo o trajeto, eles simplesmente ficam parados esperando você retirar seu veículo, se você ficar horas parado, eles também vão, além do que muitas vezes eles dirigem batendo em tudo.
Os inimigos então não são melhores, são super burros ao ponto de ficarem parados em uma mesma posição tomando tiro, ou quando decidem se movimentar é para rushar em sua direção de maneira burra, sem nenhum amor pela vida deles, são inimigos fáceis de se derrotar em nem os bosses que eu encontrei até agora deram trabalho, e olha que estou jogando no difícil.

A polícia então, meu amigo não existem um sistema de perseguição, assim que os policiais detectam que tu está fazendo algo de errado eles simplesmente começam a dar spawn em volta de você, tu mata mas eles continuam dando spawn, até uma hora em que você matou eles e assim seu nível de procurado some, do nada mesmo, assim como você ganha os níveis de procurado, eles somem de uma maneira igualmente ridícula.

O principal do jogo é ter um mundo aberto porém não há muito o que fazer nesse mundo, ele é muito vazio e superficial, quase não existem atividades que não envolvam atirar em uns manos aleatórios. Não há interação com os NPCs, eles apenas ficam parados respondendo com falas genéricas e muitas vezes sem contexto, igual era em The Witcher 3.
Sobre a história do jogo, é uma história boa até onde eu joguei e os personagens são bem carismáticos e interessantes, porém é só isso. Esses personagens carregam a história do jogo pois o V não adiciona muito nisso, a história dele antes de chegar em Night City (independente do caminho que você escolheu) é mastigada de resumida a um ponto em que você não sabe a sua história, a história do V é o que a CDPR preparou pra ele e o que os outros personagens vão vivendo, Silverhand, Panam, Judy, todos eles tem histórias mais interessantes e elaboradas que o personagem principal.

A criação de personagens é super limitada e horrível, um jogo que preza tanto pela liberdade do jogador não ter nem sobrancelhas com cores iguais ao cabelo, de que adianta você escolher a genitália do personagem sendo que dentro do jogo você não usa ela pra porra nenhuma, nem mesmo se você ficar sem roupas seus órgãos genitais vão aparecer durante o gameplay, o V fica de roupas íntimas.

Existe também uma grande falta de funções e coisas básicas que muitos jogos tem como a possibilidade de ir em um barbeiro pra mudar o corte de cabelo, mas adivinha em CP77 você não pode nem trocar o corte de cabelo do seu personagem após a criação.
O jogo por exemplo tem pouco de RPG mesmo, antigamente rotulavam o jogo como um RPG de tiro em primeira pessoa, mas o jogo está mais pra um jogo de aventura com elementos de RPG, pois suas decisões no jogo não afetam muito a história já predefinida pela CDPR e junto com o fato de não poder alterar seu personagem, etc, esse jogo não é um RPG mesmo.
Ainda tem muito mais coisas que eu poderia ficar aqui falando e falando sobre o jogo, existem tantas coisas que eu não entrei em detalhes como os bugs e a performance horrível do jogo, enfim eu não recomendo esse jogo pra ninguém, muito menos pelo preço de 200 reais na Steam.

Oito anos de desenvolvimento colocando seus devs em crunch e criando mais e mais hype sobre o jogo pra lançar um jogo que mais parece que está em acesso antecipado, e mesmo assim cobrando 200 reais por isso...",False
"I was very hyped for the game. I had to admit, but I encountered the first bug even before I started to play. 
I went to settings straight away to change a few language options and tune down the graphic settings. This game is as hardware demanding as Tarkov is. 
Since I could not find the German language audio (Keanues German voice actor is so good) I restarted the game…. A few of my settings were gone. I can accept this kind of a bug with an early access game, but this was actually worrisome to me.
So I started and choose street kid. My mouse positions got reset while creating my character so that I often altered the wrong setting (from piercing went to eyes or nose). Altered the wrong ones, scrolled down and the position got reset again. It bugged me so much I just forwarded and ended up with a weird one. 

Floating items in the very first mission.

The world itself is super cool and does have a nice flair to it. I would like to explore but the driving is so bad, I walked.
I choose difficulty “hard”, but the fights are pretty boring so far. Maybe I need to get to know the game better, but right now it is not engaging to have a gunfight. Jacke sometimes runs in and guess what? He did not die yet.

I will play the game later, but right now Bug City is not really inviting.

Cyberpunk 2077 has been in development for at least 7 years -that's when they announced it anyway so it is probably more than that- and it feels like a downgrade from GTA V which was released 7 years ago.

Now, I have no doubt that CDPR will fix the bugs and optimize their game in the near future but right now it feels like Outer Worlds and Watch Dogs had a disabled baby.

I have
2080 Super
3600X
both OC'd and I get 60-75 FPS on 1440p everything low, RT OFF, DLSS Ultra Performance and the game doesn't even look current gen, like what?
but when everything's maxed out, RT ON and  DLSS on Balanced I get 40 FPS and game looks next gen.

Also I feel like there are a lot of RPG elements and QoL stuff missing, which hopefully they will add eventually.

It's sad to see that releasing buggy and unoptimized games becoming a norm in the industry but they get a lot of pre-orders and launch day sales, CDPR got 8 millions of pre-orders so who cares right?

I'd suggest wait until it's ""fixed"" like most of the new titles nowadays.",False

"**HUGE NOTE BEFORE CONTINUING*** I have not finished the game, as I'm taking my time with the experience. And review is bound to be edited when I am finished.
Okay, First and foremost; For all the people complaining about the bugs. They aren't that game-breaking because I haven't experienced any yet. Not to say that there isn't (Most Notably the lip-syncing breaking being quite noticeable in cut-scenes.) But remember the game's only been out for a day. Before you give the game a bad mark, let CDPR work out the kinks. 
I see most of the negative reviews snivelling on about how the game didn't live up to the ""Hype"" Or ""Expectations."" I'd like to point a few points. 1. The expectations set by us, the player-base was far too high. We expected this game to be all and end all, and at a certain point, I too was like this. But I've learned to keep expectations low, and if the game is good, it'll exceed your expectations and enjoy it. This is why most games are given bad reviews because the game isn't god's gift to the world, Relax, and just be glad you got the game and it isn't an unplayable mess of a game with nothing going for it. Give it time, and when's all said and done and all the patches come out the game will be more than enjoyable. Second point. Cut the CDPR some slack. This is CDPR's first ever First Person Game, and it shows quite clearly. The movement feels good but at times it can feel god-awful. (Clunky movement at times, making the combat flow very weirdly but it's something minor to overlook if your having a good time runnin' an' gunnin.) Then we come to the ""Character Customisation"" People're quite disappointed with it; Myself to a certain extent, too. CDPR Boasted about having a LOT of control over your character's appearance, with the added genitalia to put the cherry on the cake. And to a certain extent, you do. It's just not.. Again, what we expected. Voice Options are not diverse, you can only choose from Voice A and Voice B Same with the Genitalia (Breast, Junk Length). I fall into the same category on that part, but for what it is, it's pretty good, remember, games are criticised nowadays for having too much 18+ shit put into mainstream media. Hey, at least it isn't Dark Souls level Character Customisation. (*Shudder...*) People complaining about frame-rate issues and poor performance. Again, please wait for patches to come out to optimise the game and do bear in mind that the game is borderline next-gen, So beefier computers are needed to play the game stably. Just hold tight, lower-end users, I'm sure optimisation patches will come out soon for you. CDPR take care of their player-base. Now onto the rating.
Graphics 8/10 < Not the prettiest game of all time, but god does Night City look absolutely gorgeous and the environment flows so well from district to district.
Character Design/NPC's 7/10 < Fairly decent, Conversations are a little funky sometimes with characters overlapping each-other and making for a crowded mess of random voice-lines.
Gameplay - 7.5/10 < I've cut a lot of slack here for CDPR since this is their first FPS game, so I expect a little amateur work here and there, the gun-play feels nice, weapons feel nice and meaty to shoot, and lots of variety in types too. But what where the game fails is it's movement, Feels clunky at times and doesn't have complete fluidity in combat, for just running around the town, it's great.
Story - 6.5/10 < Story's pretty good, Side-Quests flow well into main story missions and vice-versa. Not much to say yet as I've not beaten the game yet.
Overall - 8.5/10 < Pleasantly surprised with this game, For a game that seemed like it was never going to be finished and come out, and a completely different style from what we've come to know CDPR for? They didn't nail everything the way we wanted it to, but god damn it, they care.
Now, here comes the finale- Do I recommend this game?
If you are an avid Sci-Fi, Cyberpunky fan, then yes. This game's for you, the visuals will have you gawking at your screen for hours, taking in what Night-City has to offer you.
For the players who hopped on the big hype train; Lower your expectations. You'll enjoy the game a lot more that way.
For the casual people who weren't really interested and got the game to see what all the fuss was about? Enjoy, But if you aren't too interested in the game I'd wait for it to go on sale.
Overall; I'd wait just a tiny bit for patches to come out, then get the game. Or if you pre-ordered it and already own it, I'd recommend turning down the settings if you want to play it.
For those who're having performance issues, here's something to tide you over in the mean-time
Screen Space Reflections Quality
Volumetric Fog Resolution
Local Shadow Mesh/Quality
Cascaded Shadow Resolution/Range
Distant Shadows Resolution
Ambient Occlusion. < These specific settings bog down the game's performance I'd recommend setting them to low, or off entirely until patches roll out to fix it., And disable Ray-Tracing. If you have an Nvidia RTX card, you should have some form of DLSS enabled. Use that. DLSS Quality basically looks the same as native resolution and it greatly benefits performance. DLSS Balanced has even greater effects, and going to DLSS Performance or DLSS Super Performance can double your FPS in some cases. f you’re not an RTX user, you can also enable FideltyFX CAS to make the game run smoother. The Dynamic FideltyFX CAS mode scales the resolution on the fly to hit whatever target framerate you decide on, while Static FideltyFX CAS has a static scaling factor. It may not be as good as DLSS, but it’s still a nice alternative for non-RTX players who are running older GTX cards or AMD cards.
That's it. There's my first ever review. Constructive comments only, trolls and babies will have their comments removed. Let's be civilised people. And most of all; Enjoy Night City, Samurai.",True
"I am all about this genre. Blade Runner, Neocron (an old mmo), DBH, Fallout... that mix of old and new with tech and the grittiness of that world. So I may be biased. I personally have no issues with the pacing, as someone who loves to take their time in open world environments and really immerse themselves. I also chose ""Nomad"" route for this reason. The esthetic and atmosphere of the game is just amazing - it's stunning. I love it for that alone. Wandering around and driving through the city is extremely satisfying. I cannot imagine what went into the construction of this city. The road and sidewalk mapping, bridges and walkways connecting different levels of buildings, and connecting each part of the city. It doesnt' just exist at ground level but is incredibly 3D. It feels like a city in every way. I spend a lot of time exploring and am just in awe. I don't see repeat character models either. Everyone is SO diverse.

I like the characters, and the story is fun. *EDIT 12/27. Just wanted to add: The side quests are also very good imo, and I love how dark raw it feels with the industrial techno type music to go along with the vibe. Love the tech elements - mods, cyberware, hacking, and of course the crafting. Interesting skill building system. So many opportunities to customize your gameplay experience based on your play style - even though there seems to be just one main storyline with certain things that will happen to everyone no matter your choices. I heard there's only one ending, for example. I don't know if that's true. I've been playing the game on each life path avoiding completing main story quest because I want to experience it to its fullest. *

My only issue so far is some bugs. I've heard of others encountering worse than I have (obviously on PS mostly). So far I've only encountered very minor bugs. We'll see. I'll come back and edit this [again]. But for now, I love it. I lost several hours in what felt like minutes playing this game today and I'm sooo excited I was gifted the copy ! I'm gonna go play some more now...

PS. you can edit dick size, circumsized/non circumsized, etc xD xD 10/10",True
Incredible atmosphere and overwhelming detail anywhere you look. Story is captivating and characters are well written and motivated. Combat is challenging without being clumsy,True
"Don't get me wrong. I like the CP2077. Because of these things:
- Story's good (so far).
- The world is beautiful—both the lore and visually.
- Characters feels like a living human being.
- Convo mechanic is pretty good.

But, due to a lot of issues, I can't recommend this to anyone, especially at full price. The issues are:
- The game is far from polished, it feels like an alpha. Bugs are everywhere, there are lots of graphical glitches. At first, it's pretty forgivable, but as the game progress, it'll start to bug you and make the experience of playing the game worse than it should.
- Gunplay is far from fun. If you play good FPS like Destiny 2 and COD, CP2077's gunplay is going to disappoint you very much.
- Movement is very janky, so janky it makes Ubisoft games' movement feels smooth.
- Melee is abysmal. Melee only is practically impossible because the movement is very janky (at least for me).
- Stealth is not enjoyable for me.
- Hacking is not intuitive. I daresay Watch Dogs' hacking system is a lot more intuitive and enjoyable for the player.

Ultimately, if you're curious and interested in the world or the story and you're willing to pay full price to avoid spoilers, then by all means, go ahead. But for most people, this price tag is unjustifiable, mainly because of the polishing.",False

"TL;DR :



Looks: 10/10

Quests: 9/10

Gameplay: 7/10

Car AI/physics: 1/10

Open world interactive activities besides quests/gigs: 2/10



Review:



The games main story and side quests are very well done and plays and looks amazing. 



The open world is very non-interactive and feels dead once you start messing around and doing other stuff than just quests and sightseeing



The police seems to get called at random, and when they are called they can't even chase your car, as they seem to have no ability to follow your car, which means you can escape them by driving 100m in any direction. 



You can't find any actual clothing store where you can try clothes before you buy it, like in GTA V. There is also no barber shops, and all cars are non customizable. :(



9 out of 10 food stands/stores are just there for show and can't be interacted with. 



Blocking the road will make the cars unable to drive around you, even if you are only blocking one lane on a 6 lane road. Very bad car ai!



The only reason i am recommending this game is because the main story and side quests are really amazing. The world is also very well made, and looks very beautiful, and more than lives up to my expectations of how a Cyberpunk city should look and feel. The posters, ads and news shows are also pretty funny to watch and makes the world feel more real.



Hope to see future updates address these issues. If they do I can see this game become a masterpiece.",True
"Graphics 11/10 - S T U N N I N G (especially lights/reflections)

Soundwise 11/10 - good amp/dac and good heapdones - it's stunning in the same way as graphics
DLSS - 2/10 - while bringing significant performance improvements, it's causing so many artifacts, blurinness, etc (example of hair of the character, when you see npc moving head with a lot of hair - blurry trail). And all the details which are in game starting to irritate you with glitches.

People that say fps games are unplayable below 60 are silly.  If it was a multiplayer competitive fps shooter, then sure, but it's a casual single player fps where shooting isn't the only thing you're doing in the game, you don't need picture perfect 600fps for this game to be playable.. *rant over* at 45 fps, I am thoroughly enjoying the game so far, and those of you that would not play this game just because you might not get 60 fps are robbing yourselves of a wonderful experience.",True

Is is heavy? Very.

Is it still a great game despite launch day issues? Absolutely.

Even on my aging rig, i7 2700K with 980Ti, it still runs fairly smoothly on high settings. Certainly very playable.

As a game, it's hard to compare it to much else. It's as if you took all the great elements from The Witcher, GTA, Mass Effect, Bioshock, Deus Ex and Watchdogs, and somehow make it all work into something that still feels as if it's never been done before.

The hype is earned. With a bit of polish, this game will stand the test of time and mark a turning point for the standard of AAA quality titles.",True

Anyone giving this game less than 7/10 is outright delusional, anyone giving this game less than 9/10 is most likely doing so because his PC is trash, just like mine. (Ryzen 5 1600x, GTX 1060 6 GB)

Now here's what they need to fix, sorted from most to least urgent. Honestly they should pay me for this, literally just straight up telling them how to fix their (already great) game in less than a month, considering my personal opinion is the only valid metric in the gaming industry

1. REWORK POLICE AND STAR SYSTEM (It's utterly broken)
2. Fix bugs (There's lots of them of, most of them aren't terrible, some can be quite immersion breaking and annoying, the chance of encountering a game breaking bug is very, very low, though, but still, quite buggy.  Sometimes it feels like this game is a Porsche, except it's constructed by underpaid Poles, using their bare hands.)
3. Uhh, performance is worse than expected. (Considering the ""recommended specs will net you around 35-40 fps on medium settings as opposed to RDR2, where my less than recommended 1060 can easily pull 55-60 fps on medium-high. Very unsure whether they can even improve performance in the future, though.)
4. Armor System should probably be tweaked. (Since cosmetic overwrite slots a la Terraria would clash with CDPR's design philosophy, they should just sub-categorize the existing clothing items into ""armor"" and ""cosmetic"", voila, easy 0.5 extra points on the 0-10 scale. This is probably fixable by mods, depending on how mod friendly this game is.
5. DOUBLE TAP WASD TO DODGE XDDDDDDDDDD (I bet there is a mod for this already.)

"Game: Cyberpunk 2077
Developer: CD Projekt Red
Release Date: December 10th, 2020

Cyberpunk 2077, a futuristic city sprawling Open World Action Adventure FPS. Announced in 2013 with a stunning trailer to start went through a bumpy ride in development. Going dark for several years, only to pop back up on the radar of gamers worldwide. Developed by the legendary team behind The Witcher series.

So what is Cyberpunk? Some say it's a masterpiece, others say it's a buggy mess. With amazing visuals that require some serious hardware to push out at a reasonable frame rate. Cyberpunk seems to have mixed feelings among gamers and reviewers alike. Although at the time of writing, it has a Mostly Positive review rating on Steam. Cyberpunk has its faults at launch, after the leadership at CD Projekt Red had pushed the game back close to a month from its more recent release date of November 19th. Was the time used worth it? Short answer, no. The game went through multiple push backs in the name of “Polishing and Perfecting” the product. Yet this perfection is still being released in a buggy state plagued with crashes, horrible optimization on lower end hardware that was labeled as “Minimum Specs”, and so on.

By no means is Cyberpunk 2077 a bad game, if anything quite the opposite. It's a terrific game with a story to be told and a player to decide how that story is told. With a wide variety of character customization, in-game systems to allow for further customizability, and more. Interesting gameplay mechanics, enjoyable gunplay, among other things found in the game.

But perhaps CD Projekt Red got ahead of itself with this title, all things considered. More time should have been devoted to this game and the core functions. Such as better system optimization, more detailed play testing, etc. Because with an amazing world that Cyberpunk 2077 has created. The drawback simply put is that the game is in a state of instability.

Perhaps in time with patches, updates, etc. Cyberpunk will be a more playable game for all gamers and system variations. One shouldn’t require the latest and greatest hardware to play the game on Low/Medium Settings with a decent frame rate.


Please be noted this is an informational piece, and in no way am I hating on the game. Considering I’m easily going to be investing several hundred hours into the game with the wide variety of customization options. But rather to help future buyers a better understanding of the current state. As time moves forward and the game gets updated and real changes are made, so will this informational review.",True
"Amazing atmosphere, visuals are absolutely stunning and story has me hooked already, but there's so many issues that you'd mistake it for a bethesda game.

Start with the obvious - It's really, really buggy. Me and my friends all experiencing the exact same bugs right at the start of the game, from cars teleporting through walls, clothes disappearing, subtitles glitching, enemies t-posing, not attacking or guns making no sound, nothing gamebreaking so far but constant noticeable visual bugs really do takeaway from the presentation.

Driving - Not awful but definitely not good, feels incredibly floaty on both keyboard and controller.

Melee - Godawful. Doesn't look like you do damage, no sense of weight or impact.

Gunplay - It's okay, guns sound *fine* but bullet sponge enemies really don't help. (Why is a normal enemy taking 8~ shots on the first actual mission?)

Performance - The recommended specs are an absolute lie, if you don't have a top end cpu and a card that can do DLSS don't expect 60.

Overall - Unless you have a top of the line PC wait. We've already waited years, wait a little longer to play it in a (hopefully) much better state in the future.

So far, the game is exceptionally well, my only gripe is the optimization being piss poor, especially when I have a rig decked above its minimum to maximum requirements. 

This really requires a optimization patch and a bug patches to boot, so far though, definitely a good start.

EDIT: Its a terribly unsettling feeling playing the game more, seeing things break more and more as you progress, this game is without flaw of course, and I have already noted my problems when I first was jumping into the game, but I think getting deeper into the game now, I have realized that this game is missing a lot more than I thought it would.

I think the devs really tried hard to push a good product, but I think in execution the game is failing in its inadequacies, the lack of substantial functionality like combat, hacking, and just interacting with the world is almost equal to something like a mix of the bad things that were in Borderlands and the Elder Scrolls. I continue to play this game hoping it gets better, and I wont deny I enjoy the game, but its definitely not the experience I was expecting to love and cherish.

The game can be breath taking visually most of the time, but its easily squandered by its faults that constantly pull me out of the immersion, graphical or functionally, constantly having to save and load just to fix menial things is tiring, and its honestly not helping me wanting to see the better of this game. 

The influences are overpowering and it definitely makes for a great calling to something like Ghost in the Shell (the original and SAC of course) and Akira, as well as others. Cyberpunk certainly made its place but as I mentioned, the faults out weigh the positives for now, hopefully CDPR will fix the underlying issues, I dont expect them to fix things like the story as its already a dry experience for me currently but I still have hope for a game that everyone has been waiting for, hopefully that doesnt go to waste with the amount of potential Cyberpunk still has.",False
if you even remotly interested in Si-Fi/Cyberpunk setting you owe it to yourself to get this game. The attention to detail is just...awesome. So much work went into this. Sure it has some technical problems but eh..wich game hasent nowadays. I really enjoi the trip so far...,True
"My Personal Day-Zero experience and Review below my specs. TL;DR and recommendations below that.

Nerd Stuff:
CPU: i5-6600k @ 3.5 Ghz (no overclocking)
GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060
RAM: 16GB G-Skill Ripjaws
HDD: 2TB Seagate Barracuda
Boot SSD: 500GB Samsung 850 EVO

MOBO: Gigabyte Z-170XP
PSU: OCZ Silencer MKII 80+ Gold rated @ 950W

Monitor: ASUS VH236 running at native 1920x1080


Nerd Notes:
Can run the game just fine at native res. on High, with certain lighting and shading graphics tuned to better run on the 2060 (as opposed to a 2070 or 2080 which should have NO problems). VSync enabled, capped framerate at 60fps. (I'm not picky about graphics, but it looks and runs great!) 3 Hours update: Still running well. Lowest dip was 45, in a heavily populated zone that also spawned cops on top of a gang I was already fire-fighting with.

Due to my HDD I have a dip in performance when first loading into a new ""zone"" as it were, and hilariously the ""slow HDD"" option seems to make it worse instead of better? As I've come to learn from multiple day-zero launches on Steam, Mileage will vary! Know your rig, know your tolerances, and you can haul anything.


First Impressions:
The game takes a decent amount of time to boot, but that's to be expected with an open world this large and cram-packed full of STUFF. Assets, textures, models, everything. EVERYTHING is populated, as long as you keep your settings tuned to your machine. Voice acting is wonderful, as should be expected from CDPR at this point. With the Witcher series under their belt, most of the dialogue is believable and heartfelt.

Playing through the opening segments before the previously seen ""Rescue"" mission (the basic introduction) is really just baby's first RPG tutorial. (This is how you move! Press this to talk! DID YOU KNOW YOU CAN LOOK AROUND?!) But they do it well, and it really helps set the mood for the world, as well as how your particular ""V"" fits into it. The gunplay is nice and chunky, with hefty animations and passable sound design, but I think the real star is the melee combat. As a cyberpunk fan, I highly recommend a classical street samurai build, because HOT DAMN is the melee combat buttery smooth and satisfying.

The interface I think is going to be divisive. Personally, I don't mind it, and I understand this is more of a console-focused title, but having certain controls locked behind .ini files and only partially functional if edited is mildly infuriating. I'm not opposed to locking things such as the function row or windows key as is normally expected, but things like ""F"" and the arrow keys? Those need to be unlocked ASAP. Southpaws, you're best getting a controller for now, or trying your luck with a Numpad config if you gotta play it Day One.

The atmosphere. OH BOY the atmosphere. I'm there, baby! I am IN Night City! Or outside of it. Or under it. Or above it. Y'know, open world stuff. But man, it is SO good. I'm not normally huge on graphics, but if you are, and you have the machine for it, you are in for a treat.

No game is without its flaws, especially after having such a tumultuous development, and from the discussions and reviews, we can see quite a lot of them. I may have been one of the lucky few whose setup just DOES work for some reason, while there seem to be many who DON'T, even when they report having better hardware. Maybe I'm just old fashioned, but tinkering with settings and getting things to run majestically is part of the fun for me.

Misc Ramblings:
That said, the graphics settings are as good as can be expected from a title such as this. You can edit textures, lighting, shadows, ray-tracing, DLSS, all the good stuff. You can even turn off all those weird filters everyone thinks are so wonderful nowadays like Film-Grain, Depth of Field, and Motion Blur. Audio settings are serviceable, with a few equalizer presets to choose from for those of us (like myself) with no fancy audio system. 
I believe I stated my previous gripes with the keybinds earlier, but to summarize, yes, there are controls locked behind a dev-screen. For some reason. I've heard rumors they're going to be releasing patches for these in the coming weeks, and I look forward to that. 
I began play on Hard, as I tend to do with RPGs, because I believe a story with no challenge is hardly a story at all. A small update, now that I'm a good 3 hours in (and still just scratching the surface), the pain hurts so good. Hard is actually RPG hard, not just shooter hard. The variety of enemy loadouts and possible damage sources does NOT disappoint. Side-quests have their own difficulties in addition to the base difficulty you assign, indicated by ""danger level"" in the journal.


TL;DR:
In my personal experience, it holds up to the hype. It's a game that looks and plays great. It has gripping characters and obviously intriguing settings and plot. I've barely scratched the surface, and I can't wait to dive deep.

That said, do your research over the coming weeks. Keep eyes on development and patches, and come in when it best suits you and your hardware. Night City ain't going anywhere.",True
"Game is a buggy mess right now. I have had 6 civilians stacked in each other 3 times already, floating trees not even 10 mins into the game, characters bugging out and floating around and not walking around.

"""we will release it when it is ready"". someone needs to be fired for the poor QA of this game. Textures not loading, Actors popping in 2 feet in front of you, there is absolutely no detail put into collision and destructive objects. story telling is bland. stealth take downs have no weight to them. (just play deus-ex human revolution and you will know what i am talking about). 
i have encountered my parked car floating off the ground. environmental radios do not respond to player interaction. Very little rpg aspects in this title besides the skill trees. there is no choice in your characters personality, just a few deviations in how he/she says something. This is a disaster as far as i can tell in my 2 hours of playing. And yes there are little to no character customization options, there were more options in games made over 15 years ago. I do not know how long this game was actually in development for. this game feels like it was only worked on for about 2-3 years minimum. A game that has been rumored for 7 years should have a lot more polish and excitement while playing, it just isn' t there.

"8/10 if this game had no bugs.
I got in the game without those crazy expectations and I enjoyed it so much. It's a good open world rpg.
Character customization was the disappointment for me I really expected more but it turned out to be very limited and average(especially for the genitals, they had no meaning at all).

The story and its setting are good, I enjoyed most of the characters except River and Kerry I just found myself skipping most of their dialogues. The voice casting was also very well done.

The combat was almost perfect for me, Ive heard that people said the shooting is bad, but since i am no fps enthusiast for me was very enjoyable, the melee combat oh boy is my favourite, I just grabbed the best katana in the game and that has been all I wanted to use.

The RPG element of the game was the best part for me, trying out weapon builds, exploring the map and side missions, the process of making your character OP and collecting iconic weapons and cars was so much fun for me.

Bugs that bugged the most
I had one weapon named Crash that got bugged after upgrading it, and in the iconic category that you can hang in your appartment goddamn it made me mad.
Sometimes npcs dialogues will overlap and it becomes so bad to keep up with what is actually happening, johnny's dialogue lines sometimes get stuck on your screen very bothering.
Some items do not load properly for instance when npc try to hand you something a chip or a drink, they are invisible they literally grabbing air in their hands.
Npcs in quests also bugs out few times but i could fix them once reloaded.
These were not the only bugs that I met they were just the most game disrupting for me.

I do recommend this game but not right now, you should wait a couple of months to wait em to fix some major problems, right now it is not a complete or smooth experience.",True
"This game is great and all, but we can sure agree on one thing that its not what we were first promised by CDPR.

THAT being said, I will still recommend this game.
The reason being I(and only I) enjoyed the game. I didn't encounter massive bugs that end up crashing or shit, but some smaller clippings and floating burgers and all. Secondly, people are blowing things out of proportion about glitches. I know it requires a LOT of polishing, but its pretty good atleast on decent pcs (I played on i7 10750h+2070). Role playing aspect is pretty sluggish and overly extended sometimes but choices DO matter in the game. Atlast, story is pretty decent but what did the trick for me was the score. Its literally so good.

The game have a lots of bug right now i hope they fix it (after waiting about 8 years) but it's worth your time to play it and have fun in Night city.
Your choices does not effect your story too much that we were expecting from CDPR and there is no NEW GAME + after finishing the game.
I hope they fix the bugs first and add the new game+ (not after years like witcher 3) and give us some good DLC because they didn't give us what we were expecting because the story is not that interesting.",True

🥮 S p a w n i n g a n d d e s p a w n i n g. You can literally see NPC's, Cars, Objects & Textures pop in 2 meters in front of you in the middle of your field of view. When you turn around you can see cars on the highway despawn only 20 meters behind you.

🏵️ N P C's. L i f e l e s s. Often duplicates right next to each other. NPC's just despawn and pop in like I said earlier. NPC's also spawn super late in city areas. It looks and feels like a huge beautiful ghost town.

🌙 B U G S! Glitches, random exploding cars, objects & npc's clip inside walls. Animations are jittering & clipping.

🍋 C A R S. Cars handle weird. They feel unresponsive. Only the high end cars feel somewhat usable. Cars feel like they are just sliding around corners. Cars have horrible to almost non existent damage models.

🧇 P O L I C E. Literally a super police. Once you do something, turn quickly around and witness all of the sudden, out of thin air, 3 police npc's spawn. Once you kill them, all of a sudden even more police spawns directly inside you. Wtf?

"For $60, considering all the development and release issues that CDPR brought to themselves, I can't recommend.
This isn't the Cyberpunk 2077 I was hoping for. Heck, this isn't the game CDPR adverstised and sold to the public for the past years.
Game is definitely incomplete, for:
- the lifepaths they've created do not impact more than 5 min of the game;
- the quest chaining feels boring at some times and most of the quests feel the same (go there, kill some guys, get the money and xp);
- the game UI is a joke, I can't properly read the map and distinguish between quests, sidequests and unvisited points. The inventory and skill tree look like a windows 98 screen;
- the city is empty, they promised a 'vertical RPG', but most Megabuildings have only one or two floors, most of the doors are shut close and most NPCs have the same behavior and answers;
- no braindance, no netrunning, no corpo jobs;
- countless bugs. Some vehicles dont make any sound. Police and npc simply spawn when you turn the camera. Loot gets stuck on the floor...

CDPR were able to truly bring to life 'corporations dictate the world' topic from the game by lying about the game, releasing it when it wasnt finished, hiding the game's true condition and hindering the community to expose the failures.

From the game's and governance perspective, should have refunded it. But I truly hope CDPR can make ammends in a way I can change this review.",False
Looks like it will be cool in like a year maybe longer. Bad performance and lacking in overall actual experience vs what was expected and shown.,False
"I must admit I was very excited for this game even though the FPS-focus doesn't really suit my style. Although I have finished it and I loved the ending I had chosen, the whole game left me feeling... sort of empty. I am a huge Witcher fan, I love the lore, the books, the games and playing the Witcher 3 is like diving into a whole new world full of possibilities. And Cyberpunk? Flat city full of uninteresting NPCs, repetitive side quests and skill trees which, in most cases, do nothing. I did not enjoy the combat unless I got a nice headshot or sliced them up with my mantis blades. It glitched out on me so often I got frustrated and closed the game (or sometimes the game just flatlined by itself). 

I really do hope that CDPR will take time and add the elements the game is missing and the ones they promised us. It has such a big potential but I will not replay it until they add more. Customization, cool skills, dialogue choices that actually matter - give me a game I will remember and recommend to everyone I know.

My verdict? Buy this game if it appeals to you, but don't expect what you have been promised. It is not there. Not yet, anyway. It was fun enough.. but they only played one card and one card only. And that gets old.",False
"The game has it's issues for sure, however, if you can manage to look past some of the minor bugs and glitches you'll get to experience some of the most beautiful visuals, some of the most well written and memorable characters and an amazing story.

Most of the issues people complain about will get fixed over time and quality of life improvements will get introduced, but it really sucks when you see that the game was obviously meant to be longer and offer more content, but had to be rushed in order to make the release deadline and realize what the actual potential of the game could have been.

I'm hoping that the next expansion includes most of the characters from the base game and continues the story, unlike the Witcher 3 expansions where it's a completely new cast and an entirely different story.

Overall, at the date of writing this review, the game gets a 8.5/10 for me, it needed more time in the oven to show it's full potential.

"My previous review was more of a first impressions and now a little over 100hrs later and completing my first playthrough I can draw a better picture for people looking forward to chippin' in. Cyberpunk 2077 is a good game marred by a lot of problems, drawbacks, and design choices that did occasionally take me out of the experience. A year ago I essentially had the ""benchmark"" PC for this game and now that the benchmark has changed I can say that yes. This game suffers from some serious optimization issues. Granted I was able mitigate a lot of these issues by turning off the odd visual effect that served no real purpose other than making the game blurry and run a whole lot worse. I still haven't done the file edit fix that some people are talking about but I will explore that. 

Gameplay wise I still like whats here despite it being considered ""serviceable"" I like the freedom of being able to play as I please even if the AI acts stupid sometimes, I mean seriously I saw some enemies trip on dead bodies which is pretty funny if I'm going to be honest with you. Despite playing as a Street Kid the first time around I don't think your life path carries as much weight as advertised. Yes, I'm going to play this again as a Nomad making an effort to play a specific way since I have learned a lot from this playthrough but outside the occasional dialogue choice I feel like all it does is set the stage with a tailored prologue relating to your life path. 

In regards to the story I love it and honestly I think this is where CDPR really outdid themselves. The world building and character development is just perfect and some romance options (although they're are very sparse) are genuinely heart warming even if the sex scenes are a little weird lol. The story I think is peak Cyberpunk (genre related) with it going from something fun to bleak and despite the story being relatively short I loved it, if you ignored all the side activities and rushed to the end you are looking at maybe 10-15hrs but obviously you should interact with these little side gigs they definitely add to the overall play time.

Some of my serious criticisms are definitely bug related and since I'm now out of the ""honeymoon phase"" of playing this I'm going to remove the rose tinted glasses and be honest. This game is buggy, and for this game being delayed numerous times it is definitely a little upsetting at best. In my previous review I had talked about some visual bugs that weren't game breaking but were definitely immersion breaking. I did talk about a near game breaking bug regarding your first interaction with Johnny which was the game world in the cyberspace section never loaded meaning I was in a dark void with only Johnny's red silhouette being visible. I did overcome this through convoluted means (watching a walkthrough and counting my damn steps just to continue) but since patch 1.04 it seems like a lot of these visual ""issues"" have been resolved so hopefully for my second playthrough it doesn't happen again. Another ""bug"" that think is suppose to be a feature has its own problem. I noticed early you can slide down railings at breakneck speeds like a skateboarding punk but I think this might be a bug since I would try to slide down a hill only to drastically speed up and die almost like my character is made of tungsten they just drop like a sack of dirt and die. I don't mind sliding down railings but damn if its annoying on other surfaces.

Some other criticisms for me are the side activities. I like doing the specified ""gigs"" but all the police scanner things hardly offer up any real variety. Granted it felt good to just kill gangs in rapid succession but some more variety would have been nice. Some characters like Clair and Coach Fred could have been the perfect example for more variety. Clair's story arc focuses on racing and she operates a garage, why not have more races instead of just hers? Why not utilize her garage as a means to store cars or treat it like a chop since that would make sense. Coach Fred sends you on a side quest called ""Beat the Brat"" which is where you partake in bare-knuckle boxing, why not have more of this as an activity for some extra eddies instead of a short quest line? There could be more heist related stuff, gambling, hell even a shooting competition would make for some fun side stuff that could help with boosting stats it's even a side quest that takes all of 10-15 minutes to complete. There's a small quest regarding a character named River and his niece and nephew where you play a VR like game and wonder why could't that be an extra activity outside of this short instance? You obviously have great setups for them but they are just restricted to quest lines.

In one of the trailers it seemed like you could buy a house since you are obviously trying to make a name for yourself why not reap the rewards from your hard work outside of just buying cars. I liked the character creation but outside of that initial set-up there's nothing else outside of that in the game world besides having a link put on your hand and your arms changing from a cyber mod that's about it. 

Weapon customization also feels just limited to scopes and a suppressor. You can pick up weapons that are painted differently because of a faction why not allow some sort of customization like that at gun shops?

I know a lot of these criticisms seem to be cosmetic but still it feels like some freedom is removed. I understand before launch CDPR talked about having to remove some features because of some conflicts like car customization, climbing with the mantis blades, and I think dual-wielding was mentioned but I just feels like I'm restricted. Hopefully they add more content in patches I guess?

All in all I still enjoyed the game from start to finish and I feel like there has been a slight overreaction by some people especially for those who had very high expectations and yeah I do feel a little upset by the lack of variety but hopefully CDPR can fix this especially since they have made it clear that they will continue to work on it. I don't agree with some of their practices but where was this backlash for games like Fallout 76? I didn't see that get removed from the PlayStation store and that game was much worse then this. I never played The Witcher 3 at launch at I heard it was buggy as well so I can give some leeway but not a lot. I say buy this game at your own risk. The story is great and it can definitely be fun at times but if you're hesitant wait until January or February since they will be launching some patches from now till then hopefully fixing and adding some things. Give it a chance is all I say. And for CDPR please. ""Never Fade Away""",True
"I boot up the game and the trees are already clipping through every other object. Completely ruining the immersion. Crashes, bugs, multiple of the same NPC, FPS drops, the combat feels extremely clunky and heavy, the menu interface is horrific to navigate, I spent 30 minutes making my character then the game crashed and I lost him and had to do it again, NPC's just walk through each other, they walk through doors, cars, they don't care about anything. Every AI acts as if they're blind like Stevie Wonder. The best part about this game is the entertainment you get from how TERRIBLE a game can be that took 7 years to make and got delayed 3 times. This is frankly an embarrassment. The worst part is that I expected this to happen. I expected this to not be optimized. This is the standard that we have for game developers now.

And while minor bugs are not issue for me in other open world games, being constantly bombarded with them isn't helping and eventually becomes tiresome... which is a shame, because Cyberpunk 2077 has a lot to offer. I feel like I've only scratched the surface of Night City yet I encountered more bugs than in any other game. And I spend many hours playing Fallout 76 which at the time seemed like a most broken game ever made, but it's nothing compared to this.

"F*cking Masterpiece, I'm around 70 hours, taking my time to appreciate every part and feature in the game fully, and there is so much to discover still, the game looks insane on high or ultra settings.

Just know you should buy it only if your pc meets the requirements needed, don't buy it if you KNOW it won't, most people complaining about performence are just breaking everybody's balls because they want the game to fit their pc spec which is nonsense, it's for you to adapt to the game you want to play not the other way around. So again, don't buy it if you KNOW your pc won't handle it and plan to get a refund and complain about it.

Also it's not a sims 3 game, the character building integrated in the game is more than enough, I don't understand what else people need, that the developers focus on how many tatoos you can put on your a*se? No one cares, devs won't waste their time on this feature while they have created amazing, immersive and touching stories.

About the tiny glitches and bugs, devs are fixing them it's not a problem at all, but crybabies always need something to cry about right? Don't forget that Witcher 3 had issues too when it came out, but it didn't become such a drama back then, people had other things to do I guess",True

this runs very poorly on a 2070super at 1440p with high and medium settings.

The story is slow, but deeply knit into everything you do in Night City. Take time to do side quests and explore - it'll add to your enjoyment of the campaign. The graphics are on another level. I have a 1st gen Ryzen paired with a 2080 ti, so a mixed bag. I'm also playing on 1440p, but I'm still running a mix of ultra and high settings for 30-50 FPS. For a game like this, anything above 30 is fine for me, so take that as you will. There definitely are some bugs, but nothing that has been game breaking. In my 14 hours as of writing this, I've seen two floating items, one person sliding, and one person pop-in. I guess you could add some clothing glitches (like breasts popping through clothing), but those can generally be fixed by re-equipping items. Let's just say that I'm glad I chose a female character because this can happen with the men too. Either way, nothing crazy.

To be honest, my biggest complaint is that the keybind for toggle crouch is the same button to skip ahead in conversations. I've run into an area while stealthing and triggered a convo that I accidentally fast forwarded because I tried to stand. 

All-in-all, this game is great in its current state and will only get better. I'm no fan-boy, but I am a huge sci-fi nerd, so this hits a lot of sweet spots. I'd definitely recommend to anyone interested, but just check the system requirements and make sure you can run it at your preferred settings! It might be worth waiting if you're planning on some upgrades in the near future.",True
"Positives:
- Voice acting is 10/10. 
- Ray-tracing and DLSS work wonders. 
- Gunplay isn't bad for an open world like this. 
- Parkour. Parkour. Parkour. 

Negatives:
- Game is not finished. Not even close. 
- There are areas of the map that have no collision/textures.
- Possible to get stuck in walls/fall through ground randomly.
- Traffic sprites are so poorly done I thought I was on PS1 when I sat on top of a building (high settings).
- The desert has invisible walls in random places that are clearly still in bounds on the map.
- Two of my quests are bugged and I cannot progress two major side stories.
- Accessing the developer console to fix broken quests/items/etc requires third party tools. 
- NPC's T-pose all. the. time. Even during cut-scenes.
- Audio (esp dialogue) cuts out randomly. 
- Traffic glitches. Look out for flying, explodey cars. Esp around the city center. 
- You will see the same NPC copy cut/pasted in groups walking down streets. 
- Can't change your character's appearance at all, even hair after the character creation screen. 
- Customization as a whole is super limited.
- You cannot edit/customize vehicles. 
- Clothes are surprisingly limited. Esp if you want good stats. 
- Cars/NPC's disappear randomly.
- Can't easily target loot. Sometimes forcing you to pick up lots of junk to get to the quest item or item you actually wanted. 
- Driving feels like a hovercraft, but worse.

What starts out as a mysterious, brutal, and in-your-face narrative settles quickly into very predictable RPG choices.
After finishing many side quests and looking up alternate options, it was very disappointing to find ""illusion of choice"" is strong in many places. Your character ""background"" is just a montage clip at the beginning of the game and only opens up a few extra dialog options that do nothing. 

Wait this one out, they have to patch it up to playable. Wait a long time.",False
"This game is a complete lie, you have 3 ""life path's"" that is actually different the first 3 hours of the game and thats it, real rpg elements are missing, the side missions are much much better then the main missions, all enemies feel the same besides the robot guys, the driving is just plain bad, you can get to max level after you finished the prologue by doing side activities, bugs, glitches, wait for the developers to fix this mess",False
"A solid RPG buried underneath a slew of bugs and some half-baked open world elements.

If you are here for that RPG, which I was, then you'll have a great time. 
-Side quests are robust, and pretty much everything hand-placed is pretty quality, aside from the cavalcade of bugs that can break things. 
-The RPG elements are a mixed bag, player choice is pretty great in missions, although your choices are from a fairly slim list. Player progression and skill-trees are okay. There is some good build diversity, but a majority of the skills are percentage bonuses to damage, armor, health or stamina etc. There's a few good options that give you new techniques that are welcome, I just wish there was more.
-Cyberware is pretty cool. While its not quite as game changing as you would probably want, I can't deny that whats there is cool  (As an aside, one slot i would have liked to have seen more options for is the legs, maybe I haven't run into more but there seems to only be two options, but they are both cool).
-Gunplay and gun options are above average and good respectively, nothing ground-shattering but fun to use nonetheless. Melee combat was actually surprisingly solid, and became my preferred combat style.
-Driving is actually pretty solid, not best in class but fun (when its working well).

If a immersive-sim is what you want, or rather, a game that you can whittle away free time just driving or walking around and getting into player-driven trouble... well I would say wait. 
Aside from the bugs and performance, which are HUGE problems don't get me wrong, there is a lot of systemic work that should probably be the next biggest priority, when it comes to adding features after fixing bugs.

-AI is the big pickle here. As in, there is very little present. I'm going to try to articulate what I mean well, but bear with me... So there seems to be a distinct lack of dynamic player-reactive responses to what you actually do in the open world. Almost anything cool that happens is HAND PLACED, and there seem to be no systems implemented to allow you to really interact with the world and its people. 
-Cops don't exist (meaningfully) in the game world, not really, they simply spawn in behind you when you commit a crime. 
-NPC drivers don't react to you, beyond aimlessly running into your parked vehicle and getting stuck, creating a traffic jam... Yeah, there's no scripting being done to simply drive around obstacles. 
-You can't interact with random NPCs beyond a single canned line. Now, this is not a deal breaker for me, none of these problems were, but this one could really help IMO. Im just gonna say it, CDPR should just steal from Rockstar here. In Red Dead Redemption 2, they have a solution to this. When you lock onto a NPC in RDR2 you can select simple responses. Now, these aren't deep, they range from simple ""Heya Misters,"" to ""Ey why you look so long in the tooth?"" but all the same, they let you interact with the NPCs. Beyond those greeting lines, the NPCs will REACT BACK, again, simply, but they will respond to negative insults with aggression, or if they are more... docile? Well, they may cower in that case instead of trying to fight. Or run. And you can again, select a simple response to further antagonize or insult them, or apologize. Even this fairly shallow system (which I'm sure wasn't easy to create) goes a long way.
-There really should be dynamic fights that happen based off of what you are doing. Like, if you are driving like an idiot, people and drivers around you should react in varied ways. Maybe some get pissed and ram into, creating a dynamic car vs. car fight. Some should freak out, crashing into something. Maybe some just shut down, and slam the breaks. If you hit a gang van, a car chase could start. Stuff like that.

Now, despite the failings of world in terms of fun to be had as a downtime game, I still really enjoyed what I've played. The strength of the good stuff mentioned above outweighs the bad imo, and as a side note, the game has had a lot of bugs, and some of them have been pretty bad. A lot of soft locks and reloading saves, but not many of the funny ones I've seen online. I've had about 3 instances of quest triggers just not working, specifically with phone calls that never seem to come unless I reload a save and redo the mission to that point.

I hope I can come back and retract the mentions of bugs, and honestly, I'm pretty sure I will be able to. The question for me is whether or not this game will turn from a good RPG to a milestone game. I'm gonna be honest, I didn't want ""GTA Cyberpunk edition,"" going in, but If they can bring the Open world elements and implement more immersive options... This could be the game people come back to like they do GTA, to just screw around.

As it stands, I liked it a lot and feel like I got my money's worth. I really hope it gets to the point where this is the game I go to for wasting time.",True
"8 years for this?

1. Complete fail of an attempt to ""make the cyberpunk character you want"" but force a shitty personality of a walking cliche of a MC down your throat.
2. Such shallow/boring cliche story (and side story) writing that competes with Halo 4, Destiny, and Middle Earth:Shadow of War.
3. Filled to the brim with forgettable characters
4. Laughable combat that requires no tactical or engaging thought. gun goes brrrrr. hacks go zzzaap.
5. AI more brain dead than practice bots on any game ever
6. Choices that do not make any sort of great emotional or game changing impact
7. Keanu Reeves attempting to be a asshole renegade rockstar (sorry Keanu)
8. Lackluster skill/ability tree
9. Lootbox crafting system
10. Meme of an armor system that forces you to look like the local asstard high on crack just for some better stats

oh this is all besides the mountain of Bethesda quality bugs and glitches.

"After more than 70 hours I can say a few things about this game.

Are you going to get a fresh new experience?
Yes, I don't think there's a world like this one in any other game.

Is it fun?
Yes if you dive yourself into its lore, conversations and flavor text scattered around the world.

Is it filled with glitches?
Yes, minor graphical glitches that won't take the immersion away.
(I only found one glitch in a minor quest that didn't let me complete the mission, a load game fixed it.

 Cybermarketing:

(Only PC) Yeah people got caught on a promise fueled by consumer desire and developer excitement. The hype made people angry when they got a game that doesn't have any revolutionary mechanic or graphical improvement. (Consoles) Console release was very poor and deserves all the bad reviews it can get til it gets fixed. In fact I think a lot of the console backlash transmitted to the PC reviewers too.

Ok, now to what I think this review should be:

I liked the game, I got a lot of hours of fun with just one run. There are a lot of quality of life improvements this game needs (basic stuff tbh):

1) Let us click various items and select them before selling or storing! Is super frustrating to click each item and wait for a small loading before is successfully sold/stored.

2) Let us have more slots for weapons, why 3? You got melee weapons, guns, shotgun, sniper, different rifles, etc. Let me have at least 6 slots, DOOM DID IT 27 years ago.

3) NPCs need to have a day/night cycle, different greeting lines and paths. They are boring but look great.

4) There's no ""Store all"" option when storing items at home.

5) The character creation menu is very limited, why can't I be fat or super skinny? If I wan't to create a chin less character I just can't. This HAS to be a FLC soon, I can see and meet fat characters in the world, why can't V be one?

6) The DLLS is a lie, if you set in on 1920x1080 with quality it upscales a 720 and it looks very bad, you can see it on the character panel when on the menu, your character will be pixelated.

The rest I would say is 9/10 and I totally recommend it but maybe wait for a sale or the first big patch.

Just don't get carried away by those reviews that consider the PC and console version as one, I would call it media madness.


Is it expensive? 
Maybe, it should be a 40$ game due to some glitches and rough edges.

8/10

(Will update when it gets retouched and gets its first DLC)

",True
"Leaving this review after finishing the game and doing all MAIN side quests - didn't complete the collect-em-all sidequests and POI clearing out the map things. So 44 hours for the main content of the game.

Not well optimized? Sure. Buggy? Yes. I had to reload two missions to fix critical bugs during my playthrough. Lacking in open-world content? A bit.

But.

This is the best video game story and characters I've experienced in years. I truly CARED about V and all the side characters, and was truly invested in the story. Johnny, Panam, all the rest, are incredibly well written and acted. And then there's Judy. Y'all can keep your anime waifus, Judy is BAE and the most attracted to a fictional character I've been in, well, probably ever. Everything about her character is awesome.

Is this a GTA-style open world? No, and I don't think it's supposed to be. Hours of gameplay running around creating mayhem for no reason is not what you will get from this game. What you WILL get is the best story and characters in this generation of video games, and the best graphics in any video game ever (assuming your computer can handle it) that just adds to the immersion.

Final rating - 9/10. Game of the Year for me easily. Once CDPR cleans up some bugs and drops some more content to improve replayability this will be what everyone was hoping for. But even as is, it blows most games out of the water.",True

Great Graphics.
Good Gunplay.
Good Driving.

"Currently at the time of this review, I have played for ~25 hours. As it stands, I would not personally recommend anyone purchasing this game at the moment. Best case scenario I'd say wait a couple weeks.

Pros:
~ Seamless world
~ Fantastic audio design
~ World is large & expansive
~ Many things to do within the world
~ Multiple reload animations per gun

Cons
~ Lackluster RPG elements
~ Commonly stereotyped characters / cultures
~ Extremely poor performance 
~ Graphically not great considering performance
~ False sense of choice
~ Regularly locks the player out of controls / movement for dialogue
~ Forcing the player to listen to ALL dialogue in certain scenarios
~ Extreme jank / buginess in many cases
~ Lots to be desired in many avenues of gameplay
~ HUD elements not existing or not obvious
~ Redundant perks

By no means do I have the best PC out there, however, my current specs are a GTX 2070, as well as an i9 9900k playing at 1080p, implying that I’m not expecting to play on ultra settings with ray tracing on. In fact, I’ve mainly been playing on low & medium overall without ray tracing, in hopes of staying in ~100 fps range. With that being said, I’ve been able to stay in the range of 55-75 fps fairly consistently, take that how you will.

"[h1]  Hype equal to incompetence (really high)   [/h1]

I've waited for what they call a ''major'' update 1.1 to write this review but there is nothing major about it.
Let's begin with what's good (not much so it's going to be fast)
[list]
    [*][b]Good[/b]
[/list]
- Gunplay sometimes can be fun.
- The OST.
- Character enhancements, the parts you can change were a good idea, you can enhance every part of your body from eyes to legs. 
[list]
    [*][b]Bad[/b]
[/list]
- Enemies/Police AI (dumb and with collision bugs it's even worst)
- Fast Travel, the way they did it makes no sense, i don't mind only having certain points to Fast Travel on the map but why do we need to go first to a point to be able to do it, it's just absurd.
- Vehicles, no customization at all and having to go where the cars are to be able to buy them is just stupid, having a few Garages where you could buy and customize them would have been way better.
- Story, some dialogues options seem important but they are not and will not change the Story or Endings at all, completely useless.
- Side quests, most are boring (it's like they fired the entire Team who worked on Witcher 3)
- Driving is just bad, when you hit another car it's like hitting a wall, collisions need a complete rework.
- Romance, you need to have a certain gender to be able to romance certain characters and the options are really limited.
[list]
    [*][b]Not acceptable[/b]
[/list]
- Game breaking bugs, i don't mind visual bugs, sometimes they are even funny but some side quest are just broken and you need to restart the entire game to be able to finish them, this is the main problem i have with this game, visual bugs are and will always be present on every game but game breaking bugs means they didn't test the game properly.
[list]
    [*][b]Recommended Price[/b]
[/list]
- 19.99€ max, with the amount of bugs and the possibility of not being able to finish everything that's way enough.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Even with such a lazy work the game is still fun sometimes that's why i have 118 hours on it but not being able to finish every single mission even after the so called ''major'' update is just awful, i completely lost hope so i uninstalled, maybe in 1 year or 2 i will try again but for now i can't recommend this game to anyone who like to finish 100% of the achieves or at least do every main/side quests.",False
"I played the game to total completion, experienced all endings finished all achievements. Those are usually decent metrics to go by when considering if you've ""beat"" a game. 

My thoughts now that I've had some time to digest... I had a good time but if I had the foreknowledge of the condition of this game I would not buy it. I don't feel like I wasted my time so much as I didn't get the full experience of the game. Just like my thoughts on Wasteland 3 another unfinished buggy mess of a game. After beating the game, I feel like I'm not done yet... How can I feel like I'm not finished with the game after I've beat it? Because the game was an unfinished mess that had so much cut off or left that it wasn't what the development team had in mind. 

I find it so ironic that a game about corporate control and overreach was ruined by those very things. 

Why didn't I just wait, refund, and play later?

Because I wanted to experience for myself the game that was released from the beginning something that I don't do very often and I learned something from it.

What did I learn?

That I'm not preordering a game or buying into hype again. I broke down to buy this game at release because I believed in CDPR's reputation as a decent game company. The first time I've done something like that in years.

I want to play games; however, I want those games to be of only the highest quality. I've learned my lesson and I'm moving on now. I won't be preordering again not for any amount of stupid in-game garbage or soundtracks, etc,

CDPR you might have made ♥♥♥♥ tons of money with this game even with its failure. But, it cost you ""Trust"" which's not something that can be earned back quickly likely not ever after this fiasco.

Do not buy this game wait until it's on sale for 50% off as a Complete edition with all dlc packs and bugs fixed.",False
"The ending I got made me feel empty, I looked up the rest online and I don't think any really wouldn't. I have a lot of strong opinions on where things ended up with this game vs. where they could be but ultimately I think it's worth full price. Such a fucking shame though.",True
"Miles wide, inches deep. That's the best summary I can think of for this game.

There are really just 2 remarcable things about this game: the pre-launch hype and the visual design of Night City

Other than these, it's just standard open-world action, with you mindlessly cycling through the interest points marked on your map.

 The combat system feels fancy at first, but after a while it becomes really dull, after you realize how dumb and repetitive the AI is and that you can kill anything with just regular rifles and pistols. Sure, you can hack, melee or play it stealthy, but these just feel like overdoing it.

90% of the side activoties are basically the same and get old really fast, with minimal story attached to them (through fxer SMSs or stuff founf while looting).

Oh and the looting... Such a wasteful system. For every 10 minutes spent killing, you spend at least 5 minutes after going through mostly useless loot.

If you stick to the few main side-jobs and the main storyline, you will get AAA production quality and a decent story. But that's about it and definitely not enough, considering what the game promised.

Ohh and it's really buggy. Not huge bugs, but some get annoying quite fast.

The world definitely has potential, but it needs a lot more fleshing out. For example, it's pointless to fill the city with thousands of NPCs walking through it, if they all just regurgitate random one-liners when you approach them.",False

I don't think I have much to say that hasn't already been said many times by other people by now.

For the time being I can't recommend this game full price to anyone who is curious. 59.99 USD or whatever it might be for your country is hard for me to justify to others. As it stands its a one shot story driven experience that is infested with numerous bugs , design oversights or minimalist features that do nothing to add to the game.

"I've played this game for 129 hours. Of which probably about 50 to 70 hrs side quests, 30 to 40 hrs main quest and the rest just going about. I do not recommend this game, but let's start with the good.

[b]The good:[/]

Visually the game is very attractive. A vast, grand and colorful world. Great textures, sweet cars (why combustion engines though, in 2077?), and much more.

The various areas of the game are very distinct. From the Badlands (hello Borderlands), to Corpo Plaza and much more. It gives a more varied and unique feel to the game.

RPG: partially, RPG works well here. As in, character development through the skill set. Either with quickhacking or street brawler, gunslinging or otherwise: plenty of upgrades to do and paths to choose.

Some of the main quests as well as side quests are interesting and/or challenging in their situation or (mini) boss enemies. But not all of them, which leads me to...

[b]The bad:[/]

NPCs. The game's NPCs are so bad it's unbelievable. Little or inconsistent response to player V's actions. Jump on a car, throw a grenade, strike up a conversation: everybody's dumb or does the opposite of expected action.

Weapons. Very limited, and why on earth do sniper rifles don't have a supressor option available? Weapon mods are available, but have minimal effect. Weapon effects look simply copied from Borderlands.

Stealth. Stealth is not stealth. Playing with a female V and sneaking up on opponents? They're on to you 'she's here somewhere!' Hold up, you haven't even seen me, twat. And so much more. Stealth is broken and for people loving stealth, that's a no-no.

Vehicles. Despite many vehicles available, you can't steal them to own: you steal them to ride - after that, they're gone. Want to own a car? Pay up, but you can't modify it, nor view it in your personal garage or such. Very odd for that many side quests purchasing cars/bikes.

RPG: your actions do not have consequences. Compared to legendary games like Fallout: New Vegas, which had the awesome element of factions -and your reputation with them-, often your actions/choices have little or no effect. Accidentally shot a civilian, or run over an NPC which planted itself on your engine hood? Just run away from cops to lose your wanted level. Furthermore, RPG-elements like unique conversation options are very limited (Streetkid, Corpo or certain skill levels).

Bugs and glitches. For something that was in development for 8 years, there are still too many bugs and glitches. Unique events where a character like Jamie doesn't <bleep> while in a cut scene <bleep> is game-wrecking and loses immersiveness. Can't pick up stuff. You can run right through a mech with a car, no harm. But don't do that with bodies, or with thrash bags. Also, despite having finished all missions, was never able to finish the Delamain missions (pick up the AI taxi cars): they simply did not respond when I found them.

Cyberpunk. This game has cyberpunk in the title. But there is too little cyberpunk, compared to Deus Ex, various Shadowrun Games, Satellite Reign and many more. It just feels like a limited GTA game with hacking.


TL;DR: verdict. Could have been so much more, much better with proper focus. CD PROJEKT RED has overstepped itself with this game. It's not that immersive, it's not that RPG, not that cyberpunk. It's like a Delorean car: unique and shiny, cool to look at, but a bummer to drive and performance is lacking.",False

"In its current state, there's no way I could recommend buying it. The game is incredibly buggy, and the bugs range from just glitches to actually game breaking bugs.
After playing for as long as I have, I ran into a bug with a main quest, with no save far back enough to fix it. As a result, the 20+ hour save file I have is now just plain broken, with no way to progress.

"I really want to like this game as it shows so much promise, but every system in this game was released unfinished. Not unpolished, but completely unfinished. After the first few patches it's starting to run smoothly, but that does not even scratch the surface of the issues in this game.

I've had almost every possible glitch. Crashes to desktop, significant slowdown, broken quest lines, soft-locks, randomly dying while just walking around, randomly aggressive enemies, falling though floors, enemies walking and attacking through walls, T-posing models all over the place, people I'm talking with on the phone appearing next to me, glitching into and out of vehicles, vehicles crashing into me or into crowds, etc. Even in the main quest I've had major issues with quest completion, soft-locks, critical NPC's disappearing. All of it - spaghetti code.

A normal experience playing 2077: Walk into a club to solve a job and I accidentally go into the wrong room and a guard immediately goes aggressive - accidentally tap 'v' calling for my motorcycle. The bike swoops into the club, exploding the bar along the way and crashing into a club of screaming people while blasting through walls. Half of the club-goers have entered a T-pose, some are screaming, while others are still talking like nothing is happening. I decide I don't care anymore so I just kill all the guards in the club and grab the guy I need, walk him to the car outside. The club is still a mixture of cowering, screaming people and T-posing strippers as I walk out with the body of my target. The car I'm supposed to place him in starts driving away before I can put the body in... I follow it. It slowly drives away - I try to catch it in stopped traffic, but the traffic lets up before I can get to it. My quest is running away? I call up my cab, drop the body in the trunk and make chase. I pit maneuver the fixers car that has made it up to the Japan-town highway so I can turn in my quest. The car disappears when I collide with it. I still have that body in my trunk and cannot complete the quest as the fixers car appears to have disappeared permanently. I notice I'm annoyed by a visual overlay on my screen that I cannot get rid of without reloading. I turn the game off.

Even beyond that, the majority of the quests feel shallow, unconvincing, and slapped together. Worse still, the actual game play isn't balanced either so it's hard to say it's even a fun game to play. I spent most of my time playing just hoping something would redeem the game, but the endings certainly did not. They were interesting stories, but certainly not worth the hassle of dealing with this absolute disaster of a game.

I'm going to be highly skeptical of any future projects coming from CDPR, their management has clearly changed directions from the Witcher era of games.",False

"[h1]Mixed Review[/h1]

Unfortunately, [i]Cyberpunk 2077[/i] ended up being a linear action/adventure game. [b]To us, the RPG fans, know that this is NOT an RPG.[/b]

I can put aside the mediocre performance, and the numerous bugs and glitches. [b]For me, the worst part is that the game is not an RPG.[/b] [u]Here's why:[/u]

[u]Limited Character Customization:[/u]
In a game whose futuristic culture is that anyone can be anything, the customization options are extremely limited to a few preset body parts. You have a few skin tones, a few noses to choose from, a few jaw options. There is no slider to anything. There is no color palette. You can only choose between a few colors and a few duplicate hairs. There are no synthetic parts and no body types to choose from.

Worst of all, there is no option to change your appearance. Nowhere does it say that making your character is final and cannot be changed. Chose a crappy hair color due to the [b]bad lighting in the Character Creator room?[/b] You are stuck with it for life. Want to cut your beard? You can't. Cut your nails? You can't. However, what you CAN do is easily swap around your entire nervous system, replace your skeleton, add implants in your hands and change your eyeballs. Seriously, in a game that advertised adversity and extravagant futuristic styles, not only did I expect an option to change appearance, but I believed that you could even UNLOCK new hair styles, beards, colors, and swap them freely. Other than a few good options that haven't been done before (genital, nails, etc) I find Character Creation lacking and the absence of re-customization sad. There is absolutely no point as to why we can't change looks. If you wear a cap, even if your hair is short, you suddenly grow hair that is tied up to a ponytail which is finely added into cutscenes, mirrors, Photo Mode. This means that changing looks wasn't a technical difficulty, but rather a stupid omission by CDPR.

[u]No Character Freedom, Background or Story[/u]
Your background (Streetkid, Corpo, Nomad) has zero effect on... pretty much everything. The only thing that changes is the first few minutes of the Introduction and a few dialogue options that lead to the same outcome anyway. So, you wanted to make a Nomad and reach Night City. Be someone from the ""outside,"" with no connections, who is trying to make his luck in this megalopolis? It doesn't matter. As soon as you finish the Intro, you instantly become best buddies with Jackie Welles and every sneaky ""fixer"" in the city suddenly trusts you with very sensitive missions. You are given a nice apartment, a car, a unique gun and money. There is absolutely no RPG element in this kind of scenario. No matter who you choose to be, a cutscene commences that bypasses all RPG elements (building trust with other characters) and throws you in a linear story path. After the Intro, whether you chose to be Corpo or a Streetkid, you are exactly the same. You wake up in the same apartment and proceed to the rest of the game the same. You are bombarded with side missions from ""fixers""/leaders of certain areas as if you were their best buddy, even if you were a Nomad who just hit town.

[u]Beautiful yet Soulless World[/u]
Night City is amazing visually. Flashing screens with crazy ads, flying drones, futuristic cars, amazing interiors, extravagant people walking its streets. The basis is there. Unfortunately, that's all there is to it. Nice to the eye. The NPCs can't be interacted with. They also don't interact with their environment. Just slashed someone with a Katana? Well, the sushi seller next to him keeps selling Sushi, and the beggar casually repeats the same ""begging for money"" dialogue. 

[u]No Immersion[/u]
Which leads to the game having little to no immersion. No matter what you do, nothing responds to you. There is no feedback from the environment. You park your car on the sidewalk, and because you slightly touch the road, cars pause and form a gigantic line behind you. Nobody attempts to bypass you. You may point a gun at them and they don't ""gun it."" They just stay there like soulless dolls. They stand in the middle of a gun fight, they don't run, they don't take cover, they don't thank you for saving them. You can't even interact with the Main Story characters outside the main Story. NPCs have nothing to say or do. 

Food Stalls and other shops are just passive inventory vendors. Bars, Clubs and Restaurants are obsolete since they only have an inventory NPC-Bartender to transfer items. There is no interacting, no sitting, drinking or eating. 

There's no vehicle or apartment customization.

Also, something that destroyed immersion for me was the fact that there is no [i]toggle walk[/i] option. So there I am, like an id*ot, running everywhere. You want to follow a walking NPC? You have to spam ""W."" Looking for someone inside a club? You have to run over the tables and step on the couches just because you can't control your speed. It is MIND BLOWING that such an option was forgotten by CDPR. [b]This lack of interactiveness ultimately makes the world feel hollow.[/b]

[u]Terrible Police AI[/u]
The equivalent to ""wanted"" is a cop suddenly spawning behind you, chasing you down. There is no working police system, and I believe they had no time to make one. You kill someone, you expect for a few police cars to arrive, search the area, while you must either engage them or leave stealthed. Well, all you get is a cop instantly spawning next to you as soon as you commit a crime, even if there is no possible route to make it plausible for him to be there. For me that's just unfinished work.

[u]Combat is Medicore[/u]
Thankfully you can lean from cover and shoot. The enemy AI is the usual braindead one. Machete dude runs straight to you, is blocked by a box and just stays there looking. Gunned enemies take cover and try to flank you. It is not bad overall, just nothing exciting.

[u]Stealth is weird[/u] 
You pretty much always have to use vending machines as distractions to make the enemies move in order to kill them. Same drill every time. I don't like the fact that even if you have a Knife equipped, there are no special killing blows. Your stealth-kill is always breaking their neck, no matter the weapon you hold. Thus, no awesome way to decapitate enemies from Stealth. No amazing aerial kills. You can attack them with a Katana with a simple M1 attack and pray for a 1-shot hit. The keybind for a stealth kill is always breaking their neck. 

[u]Attributes and Perks are Mediocre[/u]
The talents/perks seem to make small difference in combat. Most perks are just small increases to damage or crit chance. Something that boosts Health. Something that boosts Stamina. In the end, there are no real perks. They are, for the most part, small boosts to something. Many Attributes are pretty much useless. For example, you find strong weapons all the time, making Crafting pointless. You also find Medkits all the time, making combat very easy.

[u]Story[/u]
[b]The Main Story for me thus far is great.[/b] Really enjoyed it, although haven't finished it to wait for further fixes. What I don't really dig are the side missions. You walk somewhere, trigger one, then trigger another. You are spammed by Side Missions from people you barely know or have never met. Due to the lack of the RPG element, really.

[u]Performance[/u]
Playing on RTX2070 Super. On 1040p, all Ultra, DLSS Auto and Rays on Medium. FPS fluctuates from 30 to 100. I can't say this bothers much, but it could be better. There are minor bugs and glitches, but haven't seen anything game breaking.

A few positives:
+Voice acting is decent
+Main characters are memorable
+Keanu Reeves is just breathtaking

Overall, I'd give CP2077 a [b]MIXED rating[/b] if I could, and wait for the above to be added, because this definitely feels like a Beta version. It's there. Just not the ultimate experience they advertised it to be.",False
"One of the best games i've ever played (core game not counting bugs) but would i recommend you to play the game in this state? short answer would be no, in my opinion just wait 3/4 months so they can polish the game more (like CDPR should have in the first place) and then enjoy the game.
this is an amazing game that i will go back to to play again with better hardware and when the game is truly ready to be played.",True
"It's a meh, the story and characters are very well written but the rest of the game feels empty or just missing.
The RPG mechanics are a joke, the entire perk system can be summarised as % modifiers.

"Overall an average-level 3A RPG. Here are some pros & cons I found after obtaining all achievements.

Pros:
- Great storytelling and UI effect, almost an interactive movie (main quests).
- Important characters do leave their impressions. Also ample information in the shards (recall this is an adapted game)
- Lots of builds available - may need to rere for getting achievements though because perks are limited.

Cons:
- It's not a real and qualified open-world game as the propaganda said. 
- I truly HATE the navigation in this game!!!
- Bugs keep coming during quests, although a reload game would fix the majority of them but still annoying.
- NCPD quests too sparse in the badlands (for completionists).
- VERY unfriendly optimization for lower-end GPUs. The city is almost like GTA decades ago. 

However I would still recommend it - the setting is worth diving in and the legend is worth being retold.
",True
"The story is great, the setting is wonderful (though it has a lot more work put in over time than most games, since it was taken from a tabletop game) the game is still on the buggy side, but at this point it's been out for a week, there's a lot of games that are this bad or worse on release people tend to forget how bad they were when they started.",True
"Very good, very good, terrific! GOTY! Thank you CD Projekt Red!",True
"Too long won't read: Very solid foundations, if you are willing to see through the bugs and glitches it's definitely worth a playthrough. If you don't, you should probably wait a few months more. 6.5/10 (At the moment of writing, solid 8.5 if the bugs were not present.)


This game was reviewed on 14 December, less than one week after release after playing through the whole game.

This game is an interesting one, It's flawed, but also very good at the same time, which makes this pretty hard. Let's start with the good things and then move on to the not so good things.

The good: 
The story in this game is very well done in my opinion, there's loads of variety and interesting characters along the way. It took me around 40 hours to complete the main story with a bunch of side quests in there as well. All the quests feel like they actually matter, even though I feel like they don't have that much impact on the ending of the game.

Graphics and sound: Overall the graphics and sound are amazing. I played on 2560x1080 at 75Hz on ultra settings with a r5 3600 and a RTX 2080 Super. For me this game ran near perfect (your mileage may and probably will vary) throughout my playthrough, no hitches or stuttering except for when I turned on Ray Tracing. And my god, this game does look beautiful. The sound is also stellar in my opinion. From environmental sounds and music to voice acting, they all feel very fitting to the game.

The open world: The open world aspect of this game is pretty well done in my opinion, the world itself is very open and you can traverse its landscape through various means. The world is littered with various tasks to do and interesting sights to visit. 

These were a few of the highlights of my playthrough, now on to the not so good things:

Bugs, bugs, bugs.
Gosh this game is a buggy mess sometimes, missing textures, NPC's that won't call you or talk to you even though they're supposed to, scenes not loading... It's a bit much to sum it all up in this review. At the time of writing this the bugs in this game are pretty bad, they are not game breaking and are almost always fixable by reloading the save, but that shouldn't be necessary in my opinion. This game was released to early, even after all the delays.

The AI is also a mess, the AI is unable to drive, pedestrians act super weird when anything happens and I don't even want to mention the police. Police officers spawn everywhere in a blink of an eye without them being anywhere around you before, how this got through QA is so odd to me.

The Life paths: Why the fuck did they even include these life paths? All the life paths are just a 3 hour intro and then a few meaningless dialogue options scattered throughout the game, they amount to almost nothing. I was pretty interested in the ""Corpo"" lifestyle, but alas, it was not meant to be.

In conclusion: 
This game has very solid foundations that could be something really great if these problems were addressed. If you are willing to see through the bugs and glitches it's definitely worth a playthrough. If you don't, you should probably wait a few months more. 6.5/10 at the moment of writing, solid 8.5 if the bugs and glitches were not present.

Thanks for reading my short and quick review :)
",True
"edit: but the story is 10/10. The endings went straight to the feels. :\ I'm looking forward to a DLC that's equivalent to this, much like Blood and Wine was to Witcher 3. And I wish they would get the rest of the game into proper shape.

What you won't find here is a new GTA/RDR2. It's more like Deus Ex but with wheels. Minus loading between areas. It feels similarly static as well. CB looks like what DX would look like if they tried to add traffic and more movement to DX. Similarly there are several approaches to taking down gangs or some missions, it depends entirely on the mission. The means are there it just depends on your spec. Shoot everyone, hack, brawl, snipe, etc. 

I like the story and the quests. I'd say they are masterfully crafted. It certainly feels nice to be in a vehicle with other characters while on quests, riding into sunset, having a chat. That dead rocker seemed stupid at first but I've grown to kind of like him. The event leading up to it was of course exciting.
I can't quite work out if stealth is broken or challenging. It's certainly not easy like I'm used to (DX, Dishonored), the opponents spot you quite easily. This is while playing on normal. That said, I'll try to keep things stealthy.

There are mild annoyances, such as looking at the mirror and seeing you have no pants. That happens sometimes in real life. Some stealth-killed corpses ended up on top of a shipping container after dropping them next to said containers. Also clipping issues with spawning. When vehicles and pedestrians are spawned in GTA you don't really see it happening or they spawn far enough from you.

For me this is a first game where it's more pleasurable to ride a bike than to drive a car. The music is nice and I wish there were more complete outfits. I've heard the phrase ""flawed masterpiece"" used before and I think this applies here. I've certainly the feeling that they put this on back-burner for years, in order to concentrate on other projects.",True

"[b]TL;DR[/b]
Cyberpunk 2077 is set in a gorgeous dystopian city. It's a shame Night City cannot be enjoyed thoroughly due to the abundance of bugs, graphical issues, performance demands, & general lack of polish.
Yes, the visuals are stunning, but I found it increasingly difficult to enjoy myself as I progressed due to the launch hype fading & glaringly obvious problems becoming more apparent. 

I would give this game a sideways thumb if I could, or a numerical rating of a 6.5/10.
Honestly, I would wait for a sale, & maybe give it 6-12 months for issues to be ironed out.

Over the course of the past week, I have spent roughly 85 hours of in-game time completing everything there is to do in Cyberpunk 2077, and getting all the endings by save-scumming at the end as I cannot bring myself to play any more, nevermind start from the beginning.

This review will be as spoiler-free as possible, but some information will be mentioned from the prologue. Nothing story related from the end of the game will be mentioned because I believe you should play this game, just not any time soon.

I'm not going to speak of console performance, what CDPR showed which isn't in the game (like the Arasaka thermal katana), Sony removing the game from PS Store, or anything like that. You will have seen that elsewhere.
Instead, I will speak of my personal experience with the game & the slew of issues I faced.

My rough specs;
CPU: Ryzen 3900x
GPU: RTX 2080S
RAM: 64GB DDR4 @ 3600MHz
Storage Drive: Sabrent Rocket Q NVMe
Monitor: 27"" 1080p 240HZ G-Sync

Putting my specs is important, because I was able to play this game at around 80-100fps. On mostly medium. With raytracing, chromatic aberration, motion blur, film grain, & depth of field off.
After a long session - typically around 6 hours - I would have to restart as my frame rate had dropped significantly, usually to around the 40fps mark. Restarting my game would get me back up into the 90s.


[b]Pros:[/b][list]
[*] The world is great to look at.
[*] The voice acting is generally very good.
[*] Important characters & NPCs look phenomenal.
[*] Some side quests are great & I felt more interested to proceed through them than the main story (River's story line for example).
[*] Writing for this game is great.
[*] Cars look great, guns look nice, clothing is cool.
[*] On foot movement feels okay - aside from double tap to evade - & becomes more enjoyable when getting leg cyberware (imo)
[*] The soundtrack is outstanding.
[*] The overall sound design is also incredibly good.
[*] Combat is satisfying regardless if you're going ranged or melee.
[/list]

I wrote ""good"" or alternatives a lot because that's what these things are. They're good or great, & they don't need much explaining.

Although, I didn't really mention much gameplay elements in the 'pros' section. There's reason for this.


[b]Cons:[/b][list]
[*] Vehicle handling is horrific.
[*] Gunplay is okay, but sometimes you Tech weapons just don't want to fire, & your Smart weapon just doesn't target anybody.
[*] Why is double-tap to evade a thing instead of a separate key?
[*] NPCs during fights randomly get trapped under the ground, may stop fighting you, may leave combat entirely, as well as run over bodies & fall over frequently.
[*] If one enemy in an area sees you, so does the other dozen enemies causing you to immediately enter a gunfight.
[*] NPCs sometimes see you as friendly. For no reason. At all. During a gig I was to rescue a doctor from a building filled with enemies. I have snuck up on somebody yet couldn't grab & kill them. They were friendly. So, I went & rescued the NPC who crouched & followed me out the building. Meanwhile, enemies were unphased yet said lines such as ""When I find you, you're gonna be dead"" whilst I stood in front of them.
[*] Police AI is atrocious. They don't drive to a scene, then just appear. They phase into existence behind you in the middle of nowhere, or on top of a building, then start shooting you. You can run 200m. They will not follow you, they will not get in their vehicle & pursue. They will vanish, & combat will be over.
[*] You can walk past a police officer & they will become hostile almost instantly. Or maybe they won't. It's sort of a gamble.
[*] NPC AI is also straight up crap. You can jump, land on a bottle which breaks, & cause the dozens of nearby NPCs to cower almost simultaneously then flee. Oh, but when they're fleeing you can turn away from them, then turn back, & they are literally gone. Non-existent, vanished, poof. You better not stop your car on a road either, because the NPCs will not drive around you or get mad, they will simply sit there & create a traffic jam.
[*] Unable to zoom out the minimap, no auto zoom out when driving.
[*] GPS is a radius from the destination - I found myself running & scaling buildings with the ""double jump"" cyberware more than I would drive to areas as it was quicker.
[*] No way to change hairstyles - apart from putting on a hat (which then makes you bald in the mirror & some cutscenes).
[*] No real character customisation once out of the creator. Aside from changing your arms & I think your legs although I only wore trousers.
[*] Nudity was good for marketing, that's it. You may see you genitals in the inventory but you will have underwear on everywhere else. Including in the shower & during sex scenes.
[*] BDs (brain-dances) are so infrequent but were shown to be the ""next big & cool thing."" I did 4. All within missions. Yes, you can buy them, & they're categorised as ""misc"" & not ""junk"" which leads me to believe they weren't ready for release or they were just straight up removed as you cannot use them.
[*] You cannot customise your apartment or get a new one (aside from people letting you stay move in to their home through side quests). You can put ""iconic"" guns in your stash & some appear on your wall. You can feed a cat that randomly appears outside your apartment & it might move in, it might not, sometimes it can, or it can't.
[*] You cannot customise cars.
[*] The world is enormous. Except the badlands feel so empty & take up more than half the map. Oh, & Pacifica is about the same size as City Center but there is so much less to do there. In addition to this, there may be one floor or 2 you can explore within a Megabuilding, y'know, those enormous skyscrapers that - according to the wiki - ""can house 128,000 people at maximum, having over 8000 apartments.""
[*] You can die randomly. Well, almost. I died a couple dozen times when not on the actual ground. This was from & is not limited to; standing on bottles, boxes, trash bags, tyres, a car, a canopy, a guard rail. Double-jump & grab onto a building? Might die when you pull yourself up, who knows? Cause I sure as hell don't.
[*] Some characters die & I was left thinking ""wait did they ACTUALLY die then?"" because it seemed like such a cheap death & easy way out.
[*] Incomplete parts of the map such as walls missing or some terrain which allows you to get where you shouldn't be able to go or just fall out of the map.
[*] Your eyes are on your chin when you're driving. The 3rd person driving impacts your fps heavily.
[*] Majority of choices don't really do anything & you're often met with ""yes, enthusiastic yes, decide later"" options. There is not a lot of room to make V your own & grow as the character your wish to portray, which reminds me of the next point.

"Nearly 130h in that game, just to be sure i didnt miss anything, sad but true, there´s literally NOTHING what was promised/shown/announced in the official Videos of CDPR in the game. Nothing. City feels dead, AI are dumb af. Nothing what u do or decide has an impact on the story, Game is taking your hand and leading u all the way. Skill tree have no impact if u can do missions or not, as stated above: game is taking your hand and leading u. No Consequences, even the path u decide has no impact, only difference are 2 small starting missions, thats all. The choices, omg, the choices, 1 balcony scene where u can decide which ending u get.

Game is only interesting as long as Jackie is on your side, after that, Johnny enters your gameworld - and with him the game dies, it starts of becoming uninteresting, it feels like his appearance in the game happened in the middle of the story development of the game - one of your tasks: take johnny to a date with Rogue.... whow, a rooomantic date in a car cinema, i mean both NPC´s are in the game over 90 years old. Am i a Wedding Planer? 
For sure the Author of the Main-Story had no good day, had not a single good day in the whole process of developing an intersting story with Keanu Reeves, i really doubt that he had an idea of the poor outcome of his appearance which CDPR delivered to us. I never spammed that often the C-Button on my keyboard.

This game has nothing, no soul, City feels dead, choices doesn´t matter in 99% of the game, only in 1 or 2 dialogues there´s a slightly different outcome.

Only intersting for me was the BD´s (Brain Dances), it was innovative and could have been used for or to find sidequests on your own which could have reward the player with unique stuff (clothes, weapons, blueprints, or even a romance) - a missed opportunity.
Missed opportunity to be more outstanding as other AAA-Game Creators is the missing Adult Content. U have billboards, adult shops, commercials, but why? There´s no sin in Night City. Full or nothing, better remove the rest of the adult themes in the game so that nobody feels trolled.
But ok, u have to accept rules when u wanna sell a game on consoles cuz of rating. And Kids are the coming customers. And actual customers are the fools.

"Bought the hype. Didn't experience any bugs. Put my faith in CDPR's track record. Here's what I got.

-AI is dumb as rocks. They either sit around waiting to be shot, or hide behind cover and will not leave. 
-Traffic stalls for no reason and will not move.
-Citizens overreact if V so much as takes fall damage. They will cower in place and never move, or run and despawn.
-Weapons feel half baked, you get a new upgrade almost every encounter.
-There are literally hundreds of items like food that are nearly pointless but serve to bloat your save game which will corrupt if you go over like 8Mb.
-It is very difficult to make enough money without using dupe glitches or trainers and by the time you actually made the money to start purchasing everything you would be burnt out on the game-play loop. 
-The game does have choice and consequences but the approaches to game play feel very phoned in. 
-The story can stand on it's own legs but not worth the price tag, and doesn't make up for the boring game play. 
-The world is beautiful to look at, so long as you aren't actually paying attention to the details. Look at the people filling the world and you'll see the cracks in the immersion real quick. It feels empty after that and you just can't unsee it.
-Most of the side objectives on the map feel like your typical Ubisoft open-world check the box tasks that get really repetitive before you've even cleared the first zone.

This game feels like a GTA knock off and a very poor one at that. I can't find any aspect of the game that feels like an RPG.

It is a good game where you can find beautiful graphics even without RayTracing, interesting story with different storylines, enjoyable gameplay with a lot of styles.
I am sure that all the bugs and lags will be fixed. Without them, it is a good game which I recommend to buy.

"I really enjoyed this game. I had been waiting for it for so long and it didn't disappoint. I was so impressed by the presentation of the story. It really sucked me in, made me feel all kinds of emotions. I found the characters amazingly well-done. They looked incredible and were animated so well, and the voice acting was superb. I loved the various combat styles, the variety of weapons, the hacking system, and cyberware possibilities. It was just FUN to play.

Aside from common glitches (like not being able to loot something sunken too far into the ground or the rare case of a UI element getting stuck on the screen), I didn't have any issues. The game ran on ultra settings like a dream for me.

For my critiques, I think most of us agree that the vehicle physics and traffic AI needs improvement, but it wasn't so broken that I never used vehicles. I also wanted more experience with the net. You only enter the net for story segments, but it would have been amazingly awesome if hacker characters could deep dive to accomplish various goals (a la Shadowrun series). I also thought the teamwork system was neat (doing stealth takedowns with Jackie and Rogue), but you only have this experience a couple times in the game. Being able to hire or recruit a partner would have been cool.

Finally, my only real complaint was the ending. So many questions were left unanswered that the endings felt rushed and empty, dressed up in fancy emotions to try to distract me from the fact that the story failed to make any sense at too many points. To me, it seems like CDPR was too rushed for time to conclude the story in the way the game deserved, instead defaulting it to a depressing conclusion because that's what cyberpunk as a genre is: impressive and shiny technology distracting you from a depressing, synthetic life. Not a fan of this choice, to be honest. However, if they had wrapped up the story properly and not left all these gaping holes, I would have accepted it even though, in general, I don't care for depressing conclusions.

Unfortunately, the ending is what one tends to walk away with, and this game's ending has left a bitter taste in my mouth. I keep reminding myself that, up until that point, I really had a great time with the game. I am putting it down for now to clear my head, but I will come back when they release DLC and more updates to play again, and I look forward to trying out a new build.",True

"Cyberpunk 2077 is one of those games that's very decisive or at least that is what most people see. The community dumped on the game at launch for poor performance, lack of true life paths, the seemingly small amount of legitimate love interests in the game, and a pretty substantial list of other complaints. I honestly agree with both sides, this game is lukewarm to me. I don't love it, but its not that bad.

Pros:
-Game looks amazing if you can max it out or run at mostly high.
-Voice acting for the main cast is superb and V and Johnny stand out above all.
-Gunplay is fantastic and the variety of guns and the way they all handle differently was surprising.
-The character customization (the beginning) was in depth, although the hairstyles felt lacking.
-A sizable amount of fun side quests and side objectives.
-The soundtrack is one of the best in any modern game.
-The quickhack system is quite fun and not super difficult to learn.


Cons:
-Poorly optimized, not only on consoles but PC as well. 
-The life path start was cool for about 10 min then utterly sucked. (if you don't know why, look it up I want to keep this spoiler free)
-The fact I can't change my haircut or haircolor is outrageous. Also, there are clearly tattoo parlors, please why can't we get more.
-One of the biggest things are the the visual bugs and bugs in general. It's so bad that I had to restart a save less than an hour into the game because of a bug. There are so many visual bugs, from T-Posing NPCs, textures missing, texture pop in, textures slowly changing even once you are close, cars literally phasing out of existence or just being 2D sprites from just a few hundred meters away. In my 25 hour main story play through I saw enough bugs that I pretty much figured this was just a good looking indie game not a AAA developed near decade long endeavor. 

As bad as the cons are the game itself is still pretty decent. I'd personally give it somewhere between a 7 and 7.5 out of 10. I don't feel like 100% the game like I did with Sleeping Dogs or GTA4 and 5. This game is good, but not amazing. Simply put, if its $40 or less, thats a good price, $60 is not.
",True
bit buggy. good game tho : D,True
"Shallow, short and disappointing.

Pros:
- Amazing art direction and assets, the game looks amazing.
- Decent gunplay.
- A couple of great set pieces along the way.

Cons:
- The city feels soulless, which is further reinforced by the npcs that are just milling around and the theme park nature of activities.
- It's short and has very little replay value.
- Very light on choice and consequence.
- The augments are very limited and barring precious few examples offer completely passive benefits. This is further compounded by the mentions of augmentations the player just doesn't have access to.
- The dialogue system is very limited and stiff. The 'progress the dialogue' options often repeat what 'investigate further' choices provided without acknowledging it. 
- The protagonist is quite set in stone, there’s very little wiggle room and exhibits no arc or anything of the sort.
- Limited weapon selection, especially in the melee department.
- Skill trees are filled with passive perks.
- Extremely shallow crafting system, everything is made out of the same 5 or 6 components.
- Confusing loot - there’s no level indicators on items, only rarity. Makes it difficult to know what to keep and what to get rid of.
- AC: Unity levels of bugs.

To conclude, it has left me disappointed. It feels like half of the game was left on the cutting room floor and QA went only as far as the minimum viable product. Steer clear for now, consider picking it up on sale or 6 months down the line.

From critically acclaimed studio CD Projekt Red comes Cyberpunk 2077, the most hollow, shameful, bland RPG to hit the market since Skyrim. The game which took nearly a decade to make rings the death toll for the concept of a mainstream first person RPG. 

In a game touted as one in which your decisions matter and affect the game's world, it feels like nothing has changed and you have no say in the matter. One of the key components of an RPG is player customization, and in an age where games have much more room to work with, Cyberpunk 2077 fails spectacularly in this regard somehow. Your body is a preset height and muscle mass with only pre-made facial features rather than using the standard and well loved sliders seen in other games such as Fallout, the Souls series, etc. Basic features such as barbers do not exist in this world, and hairstyles are for the most part exclusive to male and female models. You will meet many citizens of Night City with painted and heavily customized cybernetic limbs. Your limbs on the other hand are uncustomizable aside from their function. You can't give your cybernetic prosthetics a new coat of paint, instead it is just the color of your character's skin. Saints Row somehow did player customization better than a game in 2020. Vehicles handle like hot garbage and swerve with the slightest budge. You can't even give them a new paint job either! Weapons customization also suffers from this with only sights, silencers, and damage mods being the customizable aspects of your gun. If you get a gun that you like due aesthetics or function be prepared to immediately replace it or dump all your scrap into upgrading it as this game suffers from looter-shooter mechanics seen in Borderlands and Destiny. Nearly every story in this game has to involve action of some kind rather than giving the player the option to use their charisma or intimidation to get out of a fight. Expect the quests to be hacking followed by knocking out or killing enemies and then getting a reward of some kind. The crime system in this game is a joke or just a 1-to-1 recreation of the UK's police force. If you kill a crowd of civilians and NCPD officers and then steal a car you just have to drive a few blocks away for them to forget you even exist. I get that a big thing in Cyberpunk settings is that crime is so rampant that police don't care or are too busy to do a thing but this is ridiculous, send a real challenge like some heavily armored cyborg or Dredd-esque unit after the player to make them feel like an actual threat. The city feels dead outside of mission areas, cars drive on a static pre-pathed route, 3 npc's walk down sidewalks which would be as busy as NYC streets in reality. Every part of the city feels near identical save for a few unique locations as if it was designed like a dull, drab Soviet apartment city rather than a metropolis in California. The game is an action game with very miniscule sprinkles of an RPG in it. A friend of mine remarked that it made SKYRIM seem like a complex, hard to master RPG when compared to this game. Every dialogue option pretty much boils down to you saying ""yes"". Lifepaths hardly add a twist to the game besides the intro and your lifepath specific way of saying ""yes"". Your cybernetic implants can be practically ignored if you have any experience with a first person shooter: stick to cover and pepper them with gunfire until they crumple. Your fancy blade arms or grenade launcher can be left to collect dust. The plot feels generic, and because some of you are masochists that probably still want to play it, I won't spoil it. I'll just say I felt no connection to it at all with how it thrusts you into everything. None of the endings feel interesting, and are near unbeatable with how poorly optimized the game is. The first three hours are incredible, but as the story slogs on you barely care, and the ""cinematic” large end battles are a mess.

Go play New Vegas, Vampire the Masquerade, System Shock 2, and Deus Ex if you want a REAL first person rpg experience. The only people that defend this game are people justifying their purchases, people who don't know what an rpg is, and Redditors.",False
"I have a stable copy of the game, so  I can play it without the major issues some complain about. My brain is of two minds on this one. I love the game this game wants to be. Night city is beautiful, there are so many details that are beautiful to watch. I really feel bad for the quest writers, level designers and motion capture folks who made such a beautiful story with V and Jonny. They dont deserve a world with no driving ai, subpar gunplay, and other open world quality of life features present in the elder scrolls Oblivion. This game deserves another year of develpoment to become the game its meant to be. I fully believe this game will be great with about another year of development, and I will change my release. However, its such a damn shame CDPR didnt wait another year to let this one cook. Wait to buy until its on sale.",False
"This game is phenomenal. The shooting, the soundtrack, the story... Everything is perfect.

Sometimes it felt like I was watching a movie. This being one of those movies that, after it ends, leaves our minds screwed.
I think I had the best possible ending. I wanted the story to continue, and yet at the same time, after so much emotion I think the game should not have a sequel. This game for me in terms of story, should just stay as it is. Finished.

And about the bugs? Well just a few minor and funny ones.
Congrats CDPRJ! This is one hell of a mighty game!",True

Great story line! Also I love driving in the city and do some NC stuff. Street levels and crafting sections make this game even more enjoyable. There is a lot to try and a lot to find. And surely there is a lot of glitches to be fixed. Good Luck,True

"The game itself is fantastic, the story is engaging and there are quite some loveable characters in it.
Personally I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs in my 50hours of playtime only some minor visual bugs.
My sole problem with the game is the performance. I have a decent enough rig (RTX3070, 3900X, 32GB RAM) yet I still had to use DLSS (Quality) to get some decent fps on 1440P. Turning Raytracing ON halves my fps while not giving that much to the visuals (considering it's impact on the performance). The DLSS implementation is pretty solid though, setting it to quality I haven't noticed the visuals to be any worse compared to the original yet doubled my fps.

All in all it's a superb game, definitely worth getting it even at full price BUT surely needs some patches.",True

"A great game with a great story but really shallow rpg mechanics. I'd still recommend it, however if you're looking for a game where your choices matter and lead to different outcomes, this is not it. There are ultimately 2 missions in the main story that aren't linear. Both were advertised in the official E3 demo playthroughs (the maelstrom one and the voodoo boys vs. netwatch one). The lifepath you choose on the start of the game ultimately doesn't matter. The only thing it provides is more dialouge choices, that don't impact the outcome of the quests in any way. I have never thought I'd say this, but even Fallout 4 is a better rpg.",True
"[h1] I hope to update this review as the game continues to receive fixes. December 19, 2020 [/h1]
[b] This review is spoiler-free [/b]

It's hard to give this game a fresh review when most of the reviews talk [b] SOLELY [/b] about the bugs, glitches, crashes, and other things that I'm sure many are already WELL aware about. I'll leave that part until the end and focus on the positive aspects first.

Personally, one of the strongest things that this game has is the ability to immerse me. I had tried out other RPGs out before like Fallout or Elder Scrolls, but none of those games managed to immerse me as well as Cyberpunk 2077 has. Despite the currently poor optimization of the game, the visuals are still stunning enough to make me feel as though Night City is a real place with its own personality. I can (and have continued to) play this game for hours on end just doing side missions and exploring the different alleyways and side streets as I do so. It really feels like I'm there.

The voice acting, especially for V (both male and female) is incredible. I can't imagine how many different lines they must've had to record. The motion capture is phenomenal for the characters that have it, and the level design for building interiors is amazing. 

So, you can imagine how torn one might be when they see the amount of care that went into this game plagued by bugs, optimization issues, or glitches. These aren't just small bugs either. A friend of mine's save is bugged to the point where the story can't progress without creating a new game altogether. Unfortunately, it has become common in the video game industry to release half of a game at launch and release the other half later on through updates or patches. It saddens me that this game was subjected to that fate as well, whatever the cause might have been. 

It's also not exclusive to technical issues either, but also things that I just expected more from. Being an RPG, I expected a little more from the civilian NPCs, because in the current state they feel excessively empty, monotonous, and robotic. Pressing 'F' to talk to them just makes them say some random insult without even moving their mouths or changing their animation. Somehow Fallout managed to make more convincing and lifelike NPCs in this regard. 

I also expected this to be the kind of game where a player's actions have consequences that affect and alter the trajectory of the story. I did notice a bit of that here and there, but for the most part it did little to affect the storyline. 

With all of this in mind, my verdict comes down to me not being able to recommend the game [b] [i] in its current state. [/i] [/b] I really hope that the developers continue to fix this game, because it is a game that I WOULD really like to recommend to others. If you do decide to play the game anyway, I hope that you manage to enjoy the positive aspects of the game and have an immersive experience like I did.",False
"Despite it's buggy start, already nearly 50 hours in and no where near finished my first play-through. Night city really sucks you in, if you're a fan of the cyberpunk genre, from Akira, Ghost in the shell, to Blade runner and Total Recall. This has something for you. Yes it's unoptimised for now, but so was Witcher 3, HL alyx and especially most if not all of Bethesda's major releases. The media cycle has blown this way out of proportion. At it's core this game has what you'd expect from CDPR. Great Characters, immersive story, great casting and a beautiful, dark, twisted breathing world that will suck you in. Some say it's its own antagonist. It's a city that seems to exist regardless of you. Much like GTA 5's San Andreas it's satire of where we are, where we've been and especially where we're going. As the general theme and tropes of Cyberpunk goes. Out of control Corporatism, exploitation of sex to sell product. And Poetically it seems even this game is a victim of it as it released far too early than the developers would have liked, to meet the 2020 holiday under the pressure of their shareholders and (as time of writing) not ready to release on last generation of console. If anyone is looking to get this in 2020. Treat it as an early access game.",True
"I will update this review if and when I feel differently (when CDPR addresses the glaring issues in the game). There are three main ones I take issue with: 

1. The treatment of the CDPR employees with regard to the development 'crunch' close to release. This is blatant exploitation and it needs to be addressed by ALL game companies, including CDPR. If that means that Cyberpunk 2077 is a commercial and/or critical failure, then so be it. Let it be a lesson to game companies. People should not have to sacrifice their mental and physical well-being for the sake of entertainment. 

2. The inclusion of (mandatory to complete the game) segments in the story that are known to cause epileptic seizures. That is unacceptable and should have been removed way before the game's launch.

3. Pardon my French, but the half-assing of trans inclusion within the character creator. I've seen many trans people online be disappointed by the character creator. Either do it to a standard that does justice to gender expression/identity, or don't include the option at all. 

At the time of writing this review, Cyberpunk 2077 is an unpolished, glitchy mess and in my opinion highlights all the major issues with the gaming industry as a whole. [b]However[/b], underneath all this mess of a game lies a [i]fantastic[/i] story; I feel it needs to be said that the quest-line, the voice acting, the relationships you build with these characters (especially Johnny Silverhand) are the one saving grace of the game because its phenomenal. It's deep, its dark, it's funny at times and absolutely heart-wrenching at others. The voice cast of the game f-cking poured their hearts into their performances and I can't recall listening to better vocal performances in a videogame before. That's my two-cents, anyhow.",False
"Great game by CDPR, some bugs and performance issues but the story is phenomenal, the graphics are surreal and the licensed soundtrack is amazing.

I would recommend waiting for further optimization and bug fixing patches, but if you have a strong rig and don't mind a bug here and there (Like Bethesda games) then you should buy it.

''See you in the major leagues Jackie''",True
"Rough gem.

Ok it's far from the perfect game we were promised.
However I think this game is a work in progress.

Positives:

Story again, like Witcher 3 is so engaging. Superb voice acting. Believable. You feel for the characters. Great writing. TOP notch AAA

Stealth combat is so much fun, hacking and sacking.

The city is so GORGEOUS. I could just ride all day and soak in the vistas.

Music: OMG

Bugs in PC version are ok.

HOWEVER.

Negatives.

Not enough to do. Although there are a lot of 'missions' the police and other thingies feel like more of a distraction then real missions. They need to pack it more densely. Some data shards with same conversations over and over and hardly any gratification in solving them. Feels like addons just because devs didnt have the time and it's more a timesink then a real funpacked experience.

Cosmetics of toons and apartment. We need more Wardrobe control and apartment set up

The city is not as alive as could: see my first negative

Some bugs like the sound crackling bug are so destroying immersiveness.

I think Project CD Red were wong to make story shorter. So what a lot of people never played Witcher 3 till the end. Those are the people who don't appreciate quality anyway, you will not make your audience happier by catering to the casuals who troll, moan and bitch anyway. It was due to the difficult combat, the hard decisions and the length of the W3 that is was such a success.

Final verdict:

2-3 PACKED and I mean PACKED expansions, even bigger then Blood and Wine exp in W3 can really save this game.
Fix the bugs 

More extra side missions free.
More options to buy apartments villas, penthouses and make a slot for clothing outlook
Customisation, fun and more to do... more more... 
More, more more!!!!
AND even MORE
AND THEN STILL SOME MORE
oh and did I tell you they need more?
I will give this game 80%. The Witcher3 had 95%
If they follow my suggestions it could still go as high",True
"With over 90hrs played (most offline so Streams only counted 40) having finished the main story and the majority of (but not all) side missions completed, at level cap with all the best shiny items, I can say Cyberpunk is a great game; assuming you’ve the hardware to run it properly and aren’t easily upset by visual bugs. There ARE plenty of bugs too, as no doubt you’ve heard from the endless articles whining online as if the game killed their dog or a beloved family member – but the majority for me were visual and minor annoyances with the rare exception of one or two side mission bugs that forced me a reload to fix – and one instance where a bug halted progress entirely. That said easily 95% of bugs I encountered in 90+ hours of gameplay were funny rather than any type of hindrance. I once glitched inside of Panam while she was driving. Who complains about being inside a woman? Who I ask you?! Joking aside, the bugs didn’t ruin my experience at all; but I'm not easily bugged by bugs.

That said it’s not a perfect game. Good? Yes. Great? Sure, easily beats anything I’ve played in 2020, certainly one of my favourites; although I’d argue Witcher remains the superior RPG. Perfect however it is not. I strongly believe there exists a LOT of missed potential.

Night City is a beautiful world that COULD be filled to overflowing but sadly isn’t. Although there exist ample side missions throughout, I often found myself thinking “Where is X?” and “Why can’t I do Y?” The gangs are an afterthought in Night City, outside of story missions they’re boiled down to nameless faces for you to beat XP out of around the city. I felt like half were barely explored and the other half might as well have never existed in the first place. The police exist solely to prevent you murdering civilians early on, but later with the right gear and perks are wholly incapable of posing any threat whatsoever.

The world could certainly use more consequences outside of the main story.

The biggest and only ""complaint"" I can rightly issue is the surprising lack of customisation. The character creator is extremely basic in my opinion. I can’t modify my body’s appearance with cybernetics, can’t customise my car(s) or my guns (outside of X or Y scope) or even my hair. In a world where people (not V tho) replace whole body parts with cybernetics, there’s not a single damn hairstylist in the whole of fecking Night City. What madness is that?

This is I fear the result of a company tackling a monstrously massive project going from one console generation to the other during development (and the corona virus nonsense) with the lofty goal of still making a highly ambitious next-gen title work on last-gen. This was a mistake, clearly – given more time I don’t doubt this could’ve been a smoother launch with far less bugs and far more world depth. All of that said however they were getting death threats for delaying as long as they did… so what can we expect? So many people are entitled children these days wanting to cry at anything; so long as people pay attention to them. 

There’s a hate train for this game atm and I’m certainly not on it. It’s not perfect. There’s a lot of missed potential, lotta visual bugs, and some poor developer decisions here. That aside, it has been an EXTREMELY fun ride. I've still plenty of side-missions left.

A must play game if you’ve the rig to run it, regardless of the bugs.

My Regards

"It's... fine. I liked it more than I disliked it. Even without the bugs (which are obnoxious) the choices feel mostly meaningless and the world feels empty and lifeless. So many things feel half baked. The gangs were hyped up to be unique and have unique motivations but at the end of the day it's just differently clothed people you mindlessly murder. The background you choose does not matter. At all. Neither do about 90% of the choices. It reminds me of all the bad parts of fallout 4 mixed with destiny. Was I entertained? Yeah, mostly. Some of the side quests were cool. It was a better alternative than sleeping all day, which is mostly what I've done this year. But if it wasn't 2020 and I actually had better things to do I probably would have stopped pretty quick. The bugs suck but the game is still just decent without them. I don't really think patches are gonna make the game better, just less broken. Even as someone who wasn't part of the hype train I'm fairly disappointed. But like I said, it was fine. Not spectacular or flawless or terrible or the worst thing I've played. Just fine.",True
"After putting in 40 hours and finishing the main story, the best way i can describe this game is that it is a seriously hollow experience. 

So many promising features were cut out of this game, and it really shows. Not being able to do simple things like picking up a knife after you throw it at a enemy is a laughably bad design choice for a game that preaches it wanted to maximize immersion. The loot system as a whole also adds to game breaking immersion and a feeling of ""gameyness"" that really watered down the whole experience for me. 

I don't even want to get into how many bugs are in this game, Its at the point were it seems everyone experiences some type of unique bug/crash/glitch. For a AAA game this is a absolute joke to put out a game in this condition.

Gameplay just feels bland and boring after awhile. Sure its kool to try the mantis blades out at first, but after you realize your just mashing 1 button and only seeing 1 unique sync kill with no actual thought to what you are doing, it tends to get old very fast. The cover system doesn't seem to even work well most of the time. The skill tree is mostly made up of % upgrades, and really adds no feeling of growth in your character other than doing more damage, taking less damage, or having more health/armor. Other than some skills in the Cool tree and the Hacking tree, nothing really changes up your actual choices of gameplay. Also its a joke how they tied Body and Tech to basically just being a stat to open doors.

While the story and characters were decent it was not enough to hold up the colossal failure that was the rest of the game. I found myself just wanting to finish the story and bring this hollow experience to a conclusion. 

I've never been this disappointed in a game that I was so enthusiastically looking forward too. They really did a great job over hyping and dismantling a game that originally was suppose to be so much more than this ""finished"" product that we got. That is why i can only describe this game as a hollow experience, because even though it may look good, it has no real substance. In the end it left me feeling hollow as well, since i knew that it could have been so much more than this.

"Just don't buy it yet give it few months.

"It is a good game overall 

+++ Great Graphics and beautiful city 
+++ Musics are awesome
++ fairly dense open world, tons of quests 
++ story is great, voice acting is great, characters are great 
++ gameplay is good for an FPS game. Gunplay, hacking, melee combat ... all of them fun to play 
This is all you want from a single player story driven game, it's worth the money

BUT... there is always buts 
--- As an RPG game, limited gameplay options, bad attribute and skill system with an uninteresting perks 
--- Dialogue options change almost nothing, choosing unique dialogue options only open different reactions but outcome almost always the same ( only a few quests has different outcome via dialogue)
--- Story is not branching as promised, you have 6 or 7 endings depending your last actions or how many or which side quests you did.
--- AI is probably the worst AI I have ever seen in a AAA game, NPCs are lifeless, Wanted system is bad, trafic is bad 
-- There are lots of cool factions like gangs, corps, clans etc. you cannot join or have a relationship with 
-- having a relationship with other unique NPCs are not presented in the game as promised
-- There are no other activities other than doing quests in the city, there are bars, restorants etc. but all of them are just there, thats all 
- There are not many character creation options as promised,l
- This game has a character creation and variety of items to wear , but you can only see your character on a mirror when you interact with. Lack of third person view prevents you to see your character in action, even in cutscenes.

-+ Bugs will be eventually fixed, don't worry about bugs

conclusion: This game is not a groundbreaking game, not a full RPG game as advertised. Because of false advertising , People has very high expectetions, If you are one of them, This is an hearthbreaking game for you

"It really is a good game, and I have to respect CDPR for creating the Witcher 3, which is probably the best video game ever created full stop, but this game really is in an unacceptable state.  I understand they've worked incredibly hard, but they're selling a borderline unplayable product for full price just because they wanted to cash in on the Christmas rush.

I've really enjoyed my time with this game, the quests and voice acting are excellent, the combat is OK, but everything else is just an absolute mess and I feel like at this point in my playthrough I have to alt f4 every 20 minutes due to a gamebreaking bug.  One of my friends who's as far as I am can't play it all, as his game has him permantly stuck in ""friendly mode"" where he can't point his weapon at ANYBODY.

This game is in alpha, I'm going to wait until a path AFTER new years before I try to finish this game.  It's a great game but at the same time incredibly dissapointing.  If Bethesda or Rockstar or Ubisoft released a game in this state they would be absolutely eaten alive, and as great as the Witcher 3 I don't think CDPR should be treated diferently",False
"TLDR: Buy on SALE when fully patched. For now I'd advise to pirate it. Still recommend playing the game. Worth your time but not your dime. The absence of MTX & day-one DLC's is a plus... Even though it's sad that this has to be stated nowadays. Good AAA game, bad optimisation.

PART 1: STORY AND VARIATION
The story and character development were good but I won't place any spoilers in the reviews. I wouldn't say it had an amazing story, but the story sufficed for a good AAA game. However,  there are some negative aspects about the choices:
- The choices in the early game (Nomad, Streetkid, Corpo) do not mean anything. They won't provide you with any meaningful backstory and all 3 storylines converge at exactly the same moment. A moment that only makes sense if you're playing the streetkid mode. I am wholly convinced that this game was based on streetkid-V and that the Nomad and Corpo ideas were either rushed in last-minute or were there from the start but never elaborated upon.
- The choices in the middle of the game amount to not much change either. You can, on a rare occasion, choose if someone lives or dies but their impact on the game if you let them live is often next to nothing.
- The choices in the endgame, welll I'm not gonna spoil them but I  will still say [SPOILER!] that you are not getting a lot of choice. No matter who you choose as your partner for the last mission, whether you go on a solo run... the outcome is essentially always the same. Every path you take (except one) will always lead you to the same two choices between the bittersweet and shit option. No matter what choices you made through the game, you will always get one of these endings. The only difference is how the attack is carried out and [SPOILER!] which side character, if any, dies.
- The choices of love: You can only romance 2 characters. That's right. For every gender there is one straight and one gay option. One can argue that that is more than most games... but I don't. For a game that tries to market itself as having lots of choices, one chick and one dick isn't really what I was aiming for. Also: you can apparently romance both at the same time without the other partner flipping their shit that you're cheating on them. In the Witcher 3 this would cause you to get a shitty romance ending where you get neither of both. I desperately hoped that this feature would return in another CDPR game but... sadly not.

PART 2: PERFORMANCE
I would like to offer my condolences to the PS4 and XBOX ONE players. And after seeing your gameplays I would almost sound privileged complaining about my issues, but I'm still gonna do it. I got myself a new PC this month. Runs the game at 1080p ultra settings at 60 fps. Nice. HOWEVER it runs 2K at 45, 4K at a whopping 17. I understand, I opted for a Radeon 5700XT. I didn't buy a 3090 so I couldn't expect 60 FPS at 4K ultra. But here comes the fun part: not even the 3090 can do that! Let me rephrase that: the game that was supposed to be released BEFORE the newest top-notch graphics card and the newest consoles came out fails to run optimally on the newest consoles and the newest graphics card. Let alone all the other hardware. Reading the performance issues of many players, I can count myself lucky that I >ONLY< had 6 crashes in my entire playthrough. We're speaking about crashes, not about bugs.

PART 3: CHARACTER DESIGN
The character customisation was.... whack. Sorry to say it. These are the reasons:
- You have to stick to every facet of your design. Whatever haircut, body type, eye colour, etc. you choose: it's permanent once you finish the character creation. In a game where you can literally change your heart, lungs, limbs and spine I expected that barbershops would exist, but sadly not. I can change my entire eyeball, but not the colour with a simple coloured lense. 
- I'll be blunt and honest about this one, the meme that everybody seemed to be hyped about: customisable genitals. Except... you don't get to do anything with them. You can ONLY see your customised genitals in your inventory menu if you unequip your pants. If you exit the menu and look down, you will see that V is still wearing his underwear despite being naked in the menu. There are plenty of (optional) sex scenes in the game but again, no genitals are shown during the interaction. The game is 18+, it contains genitals and it contains sex, but never both at the same time. And never in public. Why? Apparently committing acts of terrorism doesn't get you into trouble but streaking does.
- The clothes in the game look... horrible. Most setups look absolutely horrible. Even if you try to go fashionable without caring about armour stats, you will still find yourself often disappointed at how you look. BUT that doesn't matter all too much since apparently the entire game is first person, which is also a point of criticism. I really don't like playing games like these in first person mode.
- The limited visual cyberware: I think I've got so many body parts replaced that my weight has doubled because of all the metal, but I barely see a difference. Some dots on my arm and a patch on my hand. Not exciting me that much. I had expected my jumping legs to look like bionic legs but nopes. No visible eye-modifications, no metal plates on my chest. 

PART 4: DIFFICULTY
When you start the game, combat seems a bit hard when it comes to aim (but that could be me since I'm not used to FPS). However, the difficulty gradually plummets down the drain quite fast:
- The moment you install mantis blades onto your arms, you've essentially beaten the game unless you play on hard or very hard mode. Roll the credits. One only needs to level their body up a bit and then go and massacre enemies by slashing through them. I must say that there's nothing as satisfying as completely dismembering all 4 limbs and finishing it off with a decapitation... But the easiness of it all makes it a little bit boring in the long run. Almost all power attacks become instant KO's with a relatively long animation. So either toggle up the difficulty or lock yourself into a no-armour + no-healing run to make it more intense.
- Cops. I get that in a dystopian future the police is either omnipresent or it's a downright anarchy... But the problem here is that the police IS omnipresent but they all suffer from Alzheimer's disease. It's fairly easy to ditch police in GTA but in Cyberpunk one only needs to drive 1, at most 2 blocks for the cops to lose interest. More about this will be written in part 5. 
- Cops 2: There is no way to survive a head-on engage with the police. Your wanted level jumps up insanely fast and within 10 seconds loads of cops and drones literally teleport to your location and start attacking you at light speed. Surely, you can ditch them easily enough with even the slowest vehicle. But don't even think about confronting them. It's not worth it. Not one bit.
- Driving. I don't know what's up with this but driving a vehicle in Night City is enough to call it Nightmare City. The traffic is dense. Why grind for an expensive car when you can only reach top speed in the badlands before crashing into a jam at the traffic lights? Steering, braking and drifting feel quite unnatural. Car damage is like GTA San Andreas. There's a thin line between your car looking fine and your car bursting into flames. Let us not talk about motorcycles. One can rear-end an SUV with a motorcycle at 100 MPH and all we get is an instant stop. No damage, no falling from the bike.

PART 5: THE NPC AI:
I don't really know what this is but... it looks like they've made the AI as NPC-like as possible. I can't put my finger on it but... the way they drive, the way they act when you pull a gun, the way they interrupt you with useless missions when you're in the middle of a terrorist attack... You can't even decline the missions. You can only choose to make them your active mission.  Everybody is half a robot and they act that way too.",True
"This review contains spoilers. Skip to the end for the TL;DR

Listen, I did everything in this game. I did all the gigs, the scanner hustles, the races, the tarots, the cyberpsychos, every last bit. My total playtime was 67 hours. I paid 79.99 Canadian for it. It was worth every penny. 

The game has jank, its not perfect, but I think that adds to its charm. When you look passed it, when you have a connection with your version of V as I did, the story hits you deep and it keeps you with it the whole way around. Cyberpunk is a game about loss, from the loss of friends, family, loved ones, to humanity, empathy, and ultimately depending on your choices, V's own body. You can go about four to five routes to reach the end but ultimately it is the same from start to end with only the final mission really changing. 

If you do as I did, you make a lot of friends, people who want to see you succeed and want you to live to see another day once everything's said and done. If you do the opposite, you have a lot of enemies or corpses and reach your destination as alone as you are when you wake up after the prologue.

The Romances feel.. really good. Panam and Judy are locked behind gender requirements. You need a Male V with a Male voice to romance Panam, and a Female V with a Female voice to romance Judy. No matter who you pick, you leave a big V sized hole in the other. Not to say the characters require V, but more like.. had you been the correct gender you could've supported them in their hour of need and as the old saying goes: ""Love heals all wounds."" Side note: You can also romance River Ward, but he's just my homie, a soft replacement for Jackie but no one can ever replace Cyberpunk Joe Barbaro.

For my finale in NC, I went with Panam and ultimately decided upon leaving the city with the Aldecaldos (Panams Nomad clan). Everything about this ending felt right. Maybe to others, the experience will be different, in fact I am sure it will be but to me it was a bittersweet ending, a ending of hope but grim tidings. The final scene, cruising across a lake with the love of my choice on a Tank, it was just so beautiful.

I ran the game on Medium settings, with a 1660 6gb nvidia card. The game ran well with minor bugs and a few ones that I actually needed to reload for. My game never CTD (Crashed to Desktop) and sat at a stable 45-60 fps with slightly higher during hours of less in game traffic.

There is a small need for content, after all I didn't speedrun the game, 60 hours and all the content only barely got me to max level and after the game is over you are basically stuck in a freeroam world where by my own experience nothing can pose any threat to you. While others would complain about dynamic recurring missions or radiant quests, I feel like a system for end-game could've been added to give end-game an actual reason to be played. 

To address the bugs, there are qutie a handful that will directly affect your time with the game. Either requiring a reload of a save or the use of cheats to keep your character moving at a speed above walking (Had a carryweight glitch that progressively ate all my capacity, had to use a trainer for the remainder of the game) however, as I said above, look past those and you'll find the diamond we were all promised and in time you won't even have to look for it.


TL;DR: Its good, its worth it, play it at your own descretion, make sure you have a alright rig, don't play on potatos. If its not good enough for you, give it some time. Think of it as a less buggy Cyberpunk Fallout New Vegas and for the love of god have fun with it.",True
"Seven years. Seven years in development, a £50 asking price for the game.

Is it worth it? No. The game, as it stands, is a buggy mess. Just with 4 hours of playtime, I've encountered 2 game-breaking bugs that require me to restart my save and replay 20 minutes of gameplay to fix. I'm unable to speak to certain NPCs that I need to speak to to progress through missions, and when I FINALLY managed to get the ""talk"" button to appear, the NPC literally vanished before my eyes into nothing, then I had to restart my save again, replaying 15 minutes of the game to get the NPC to talk.

I get certain things are overlooked, but it's hard to believe this game was even playtested to any real point before launch lmao. It's like they looked at the game and said, ""yeah, it [b] LOOKS [/b] good, and then released it. I'd rather the game be delayed for another few months than deal with the amount of bugs this game has given me - hell, sometimes I even need to press the ""q"" button several times before the camera will transition into third-person when I am driving. Like, seriously? 

Floating props are not uncommon, the AI feels kind of robotic, minor bugs are rampant, and major bugs are not uncommon. It's a great game, yes, but it needs some real fixing up before I'd be happy sinking £50 of my money into it. In its current state, I'd say it's worth no more than £30.

Cyberpunk is a true open-world game, with dialogue options, First Person Shooter mechanics, romance options, great gun play and combat, stealth, skill trees, and it truly does succeed in making you feel as if you are inside a futuristic city - the attention to detail is immense, with small things such as the news on TV only adding to the effect. However, I can't help but feel the amount of bugs I've encountered simply cannot be dismissed, especially considering the fact that this game has been in development for almost 7 years.

My advice is to wait until this game is on sale, or wait until the bugs are all smoothed over before paying full price. The only reason why I continue to play the game is because I am past the playtime limit for refunds - otherwise, I would willingly refund the game and wait until bug fixes.",False
"Besides some annoying bugs, this game is amazing. Probably the best rpg shooter to ever come out. CDPR did a great job with this game so if you loved Witcher 3, this is a no-brainer. One rigorous playthrough took about 80-85 hours, and I loved every bit of it.  Multiplayer and DLC in the future will for sure have me coming back, as well as other starting a new playthough using different styles. From my first playthrough I was able to reload saves and I found several endings, and I'm sure I still havent seen everything in this game even after all these hours. Been waiting for this game forever and I believe it lived to the hype. Awesome world. Thanks Night City.",True
"Should have delayed the release for another year.
No game breaking bugs, but immersion quickly goes down the longer you play.
-T-Posing AI
-AI stuck in each other
-Trees visible through walls
-Jackie pulled a gun out of his head instead of the bio chip and put that huge ass thing muzzle first right in my ear
-I died while being chased by drones, respawned, now instead of the drones flying behind me, they fly 300m infront of the car and I cant shoot them (had to reload an earlier save to fix it)
-Loads of more visual bugs, I won't even bother explaining

A great game, absolutely awesome, but such a buggy mess that it completly destroys the immersion every 20 minutes or so.
As I said before, those are not game breaking bugs, it's just many small annoying things that could have been polished if the game was delayed again.

If you want a good experience, just wait a few months.",False
"Overall, I've really enjoyed this game so far and has proven to be loads of fun in many ways. 
(TL:DR at the bottom)

However, it isn't without its flaws. For the most part, many of the aspects the devs went on about are untrue, and this game is far from as 'revolutionary' as it was hyped up to be. For instance, the AI is quite bad, especially when comparing to a game like GTA, which came out in 2013. All those ""unique"" encounters they went on about are pretty scarce unless strictly talking about side jobs or random muggings around the city. For the most part, the AI is just very dumb and mindless. Pointing a gun at a civilian on the street or in a car will simply make them stand still and maybe cower in fear, but that's about the most you're going to get. They will never do anything, nor will they attempt to run away or fight back. When once again comparing this to GTA civilians, it's like night and day. The same can be said for the police, which is essentially nonexistent and omnipresent at the same time in Cyberpunk. There could be no cops to be seen whatsoever but if you kill one civilian, they will literally teleport near you and start shooting you. It's so blatant, you can literally see them appear out of thin air in most cases. But, not to worry, you can legitimately drive around the block, no matter how wanted you are in most cases, and by the time you come back around you've lost your wanted level. It's pretty pointless. 

One other aspect that was mostly untrue was how impactful your choices would be on V, as well as the world around him. Don't get me wrong, your choices aren't without consequence in many different ways, but it's nothing that hasn't been done before. Probably the biggest area that might annoy a lot of people in regard to this is the personalization of V. While you can customize literally [i] everything [/i] appearance-wise, you are still playing as V. His/her main goal in the game is to become notorious in night city, and there is no way the player has much if any control on V's main goals or ambitions in night city. [spoiler] (that being said, this is still somewhat untrue due to the different endings, however for the most part throughout the game V's main goal cannot be altered much by the player) [/spoiler]

Additionally, there are loads of bugs, glitches, and many graphical errors. At the time of this review, I have a GTX 1070 and get around ~90fps with medium/high settings. It doesn't look phenomenal at times but these issues along with the bugs and glitches can and will all be fixed with time.

While that does sound like a lot of negatives, I do believe this game redeems most of that with its fun and rewarding gameplay and leveling, as well as the incredibly intriguing and action-packed world it has created. From the immense lore and detail to every aspect of Night City and the world it's in, to the charming and well written characters within it, the game's story will pull you in if nothing else. The main story as well as side quests are so well written, witty, and charming that it's hard not to love every single interaction with V and someone from Night City and beyond. With loads of references to various books, movies, shows, and other games, there are plenty of amusing and entertaining aspects throughout the plethora of quests to keep you playing. Most if not all of the performances from the actors are top-tier, and when combined with the especially intriguing stories in Cyberpunk, I've felt truly immersed countless times. This immersion only tends to then break when encountering glitches or bugs, but they're truly not as bad as people tend to make them seem. 

On top of the beautifully written main story, side quests, and characters, you have the fun and engaging leveling and gameplay. While some quests can tend to get repetitive such as the NCPD scanner hustles, many of the side jobs and missions are very unique in their own right, and when paired with the gameplay makes for a lot of fun. Whether you'd rather go in guns blazing and loud, or sneaking around silently, just about every mission leaves it up to you. Even better, quickhacking serves to assist your gameplay experience no matter which you choose, and only amplifies the fun of combat [i] or [/i] stealth. Then, you have the plethora of skills and attributes you can level up and assign points to, which is very detailed in its own right.

In my personal opinion, it would have probably been cool to have a 'driving' skill tree that you could have under the ""Cool"" or ""Technical Ability"" skills, and could level your ability to drift or shoot while driving, but I assume there probably wouldn't be enough depth there. 

Anyway, the leveling is pretty rewarding in its own way, and the loot even more so. If anything, there's almost too much loot in some cases, but for the most part it's quite fun to find a new favorite gun with great stats, high rarity, and mod slots. This goes even further when customizing the cybernetics in V, and I always get excited to try a new quickhack, body part, cyberdeck, or ability/passive from a different piece of chrome in V. These aspects of using new loot weapons and cybernetics is made even more fun when unlocking new skills that compliment various aspects of the gameplay experience in and out of combat. For instance, a new cyberdeck just granted me more RAM and quickhack slots, and by leveling my intelligence and quickhacking, I gain even more RAM and different perks that will make quickhacking more effective. Or, if I keep leveling body and annihilation, that new shotgun I picked up earlier is going to be even more effective with all the new passives I’ve gained from leveling in this skill tree. 

[h1] TL;DR [/h1]
All in all, the gameplay is fun, the leveling/looting is rewarding,  and the story is incredible, intriguing, and immersive. The side quests are detailed in their own right and makes for many unique experiences, and even more immersion into an already detailed and complicated world. The downsides are that the AI (in most cases) is kinda braindead and while it's still a quite detailed RPG (the customization is there) don't expect to have full control on the world and your character in every regard. My advice, don't go in expecting this to be god's gift to videogames, nor the 'revolutionary' game it was hyped to be. It definitely has its flaws, though many of which can be fixed with time. To me, the shining points of this game come from the many stories told in this very complex, chaotic, and detailed world CDPR has created, along with the fun gameplay. These aspects of the game tend to make up for most of the faults in it for me. I still really recommend it, and enjoy it a lot, but if you're on the fence and aren't looking for a very story-rich experience, I'd wait for a sale.",True
"I really like this game.

I completed the main story and everything there is to do in night city. Apparently, there is a mission I haven't done, but it doesn't come up, so I guess it's broken.

Which leads to the first point I want to mention. I have experienced a few glitches and bugs, but, exept for that one missing mission, they do not exceed the amount that I would say is to be expected in a newly released open-world game. The AI feels a bit dumb in some cases, especially people on the road.

Graphically the game looks extremely good, even on my not up-to-date hardware (Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080). I could not activate raytracing which I assume would have brought it to a completely different level.

One of the main critisisms I have read is that the game is a shallow experience, that none of the gameplay-systems are deep enough. I used stealth for most of the game and I have to say, I enjoyed playing a lot. I tried a bit of hacking and gunplay too and these where fun enough for my tastes as well. Nothing was very complex that is true, but I got a lot out of it anyways.

The story kept me interested in what was going to happen next, which is probably mostly due to the well written characters Cyberpunk 2077 has. The beginning felt a bit rushed, but once I had arrived in Night City properly, every mission was exiting and fun to experience. I really liked the ending I got and I will probably start a new game soon to experience different endings. (I know that I could get most of them on my first character with some safe-scumming, but I wanted to keep that char ""clean"", when it comes to the ending) Some side-missions were particularly good and left a lasting impression and with one exception, I enjoyed all of them. [spoiler]That one exception are the Boxing Matches. They felt overly difficult and not in a fun way at that.[/spoiler]

The crowning jewel of Cyberpunk 2077, I think, is the world that was created here. Night City is impressively immersive. Only a few games were able to enveloped me to such a degree.

I am excited for the things that are still to come and I hope everyone will be able to enjoy the game as much as I have as soon as possible (looking at the console players).",True
"This is an early-access game. An unfinished mess in parts.
Broken or non-existent AI and bad combat mechanics. Bugs galore, dialogue mistakes, missing/cut content.

The elements of the game that are finished are stunning, this includes the design of the open world and set pieces in the main story.  But these only serve as reminders of what could have been, which is greatly disappointing.

"Let me start by saying The Witcher 3 is the best game I have ever played and probably will ever play. After the mediocre hype for that game and the outstanding results, a lot of people figured that would be the standard for CD Projekt Red. I'm not here to jump on a bandwagon and bash the company for one mistake, I just want to say that this game is mediocre. Be warned, there are [b] spoilers [/b] ahead. No seriously, there are major spoilers for the games that I talk about ahead, including this one and they don't have censors so read at your own discretion. 

[h1] The Good [/h1]
Great narrative plus Keanu Reeves is constantly by your side. The main quest of the game goes in a good direction with multiple possible endings based on your experiences outside the main story and your survival. The exploration of terrorist versus freedom fighter is also really interesting. The side quests take the cake though, with moral decisions and characters that V can get closer to based on decisions. The perks and leveling is similar to The Witcher, most of the perks are flat damage increases with a few utility examples but nothing extraordinary. The hacking is pretty cool, I've never played another game with hacking mechanics like Watch Dogs so my experience here is lacking but I thought it was fun. The gunplay is about what you'd expect--point, shoot, recoil. Not much more to ask for there really. The use of tiered items and modifications is good and leads to a constant need to raise the quality of your gear. I actually like the driving. I've heard a lot of people complain about it but it's the most realistic driving I've ever experienced in a game. Performance issues aside, the game looks amazing. The people and all of Night City are breathtaking. Even though I don't recommend the game I still find it fun. It's just not what was advertised.

[h1] The Bad [/h1]
I'm not gonna say it's bad because it's short, this isn't The Outer Worlds. There's a lot of replayability and, according to howlongtobeat.com, doing the main and side quests takes an average of 41.5 hours while completionist takes an average of 81. That's a pretty good amount of time for a replayable game, but let's make a comparison. I'm gonna be comparing this game to The Witcher 3 a lot from this point on because they are both RPGs made by the same company. The Witcher takes an average of 102 hours for main and side quests, while completionist takes 173 hours. That's literally twice the content from a game that was less hyped and less funded. The Witcher had a rough start to with some bugs but not like this game. Now, beyond playtime there's the bad part of the story. 

There are two acts in this game. In Act I, V becomes a mercenary working with Jackie after leaving his / her life path. V ends up being exactly the same character no matter what life path you choose with no real consequence. The only effects of the life path include dialogue options which can always be circumvented. In an RPG, there are two types of main characters. There's the Fallout and Elder Scrolls kind, (except Fallout 4 but we'll come back to that) and there's The Witcher 3 kind. In Fallout: New Vegas, the courier is given very little background. It's like D&D, you choose your character's personality, a vague background, and then make choices based on that. There's no voice actor because that would take an extreme amount of time to record all the possible lines with every inflection, when instead you can decide how the character sees the world and have them react accordingly. This leads to endless replayability and combinations of choices. The other end of the spectrum is The Witcher 3. Geralt is based on a character from the works of Andrzej Sapkowski, and he has a set personality, voice, and view of the world. The effect that the player can have on the world through Geralt is in situations where his personality could allow him to make multiple decisions. This creates a game where the story can be well crafted and thought out while allowing different possible endings and consquences. I can't count how many times I've stumbled across a monster or a person that I save / screwed over and saw the consequences. That literally never happens in Cyberpunk. However, you can't just decide that Geralt kills one of the main cast whenever you want like you could with anyone in New Vegas. Now, let's take a look at Fallout 4 and Cyberpunk. These games rest in the middle of the spectrum, you're given a character with a very generic background, like I mentioned in Fallout: New Vegas, but with a dedicated male or female voice actor. This was one of the main complaints about Fallout 4 that people who like 3 and New Vegas had. And, I never thought I'd say this, but Fallout 4 actually did it better than Cyberpunk here. If V had even a quarter the depth that Geralt has, I wouldn't be saying this. But V doesn't. The character in Fallout 4 is hardly limitless, with four similar options always being present for dialogue, but at least you have a choice. V is always a douchebag mercenary who doesn't give a fuck, or a douchebag mercenary who cares a little. No in between, no character development, no choice that the player can have to make them any different. 

Then there's act II, where you steal the relic, Jackie dies, and you get Johnny Silverhand starting to take over your mind. This is the part where the game opens up and you get to explore all Night City with Keanu Reeves offering a witty remark to everything you do. I'm not going to bash Keanu though, even if the voice acting for Johnny is a bit flat he's still the most interesting character in the game by a long shot. After Jackie dies, I chose to go to his funeral, mend the relationship between his mother and Misty, and say a few kind words. It was one of the better quests in the game but I never really felt sad. The player has no chance to actually get to know Jackie. You meet him, there's a time skip to 6 months later, and then he's dead. And the portrayal of death in Night City is meant to be part of the corrupt capitalism theme, I get that, but I feel like the main characters should be barred from this in the writing. In The Witcher 3, when Vesemir dies I cried. He was like the only father figure that Geralt ever had and a grandfather to Ciri. The side quests in Cyberpunk, like with Panam and Judy are really, really good. They are the strongest part of the game, but even they fall short since there's little to no consequence afterwards. 

[h1] The Ugly [/h1]
Yikes. For a game that recommends you have at least a GTX 1060 to play, the performance is laughable. I have a 1080 ti and I can't even hold 60 on the lowest settings. The AI sucks. The police don't chase you, they just spawn near you. The game has literally been removed from the Playstation Store because it ran so bad that Sony felt guilty for having it. At least CD Projekt Red is offering refunds though. Only on consoles. I wouldn't expect a refund at this point, I've put 70 hours into the game. But what about the people who pre-ordered this game and have a 1060? They play 3 hours to find that the game can't reach 30 fps and get robbed of $60? 'Nuff said. Oh, and the character customization sucks. Remember when we were promised it to be one of the most impressive features of the game? It's all presets. Yeah you can customize your penis but there's only 6 total combinations and you never even see it again. It's a gimmick. 

[h1] TL;DR [/h1]
The gameplay is mediocre, story is interesting but limited, and the characters are all unconvincing. The performance and optimization is terrible across the board. There are bugs in quests that sometimes prevent you from continuing the main story. In its current state, don't buy it at all. When the fix it, maybe buy it when it's on sale.
Yours truly, a disappointed fan of CD Projekt Red.",False
"this game I wasnt too excited for it going in with minimal expectations and I still found things very boring and dull when it came to some aspects of this game, the combat is alright but not for me, if you've played an rpg shooter you will probably enjoy it. I did enjoy a few side quests but it didnt make me want to keep playing the game. Also this game is running on a decent pc build and medium ish settings getting 40-50 fps (now that is with ray tracing enabled so you will see better performance without it).

also bugs in this game are funny as hell, but if you are picky about how polished your game is do not buy this game in its current state.",False
"TL;DR - this game is incredibly fun; from the graphics to the story, CD PROJEKT RED hit the nail on the head and deserves those 10/10s. The game has a few bugs, like most RPGs, but it is not unplayable. An occasional restart of the game may be necessary. Absolutely recommend. 75+ hours in, and still not halfway done with the content in the game. 

ENABLE LIVE FEEDBACK ANALYTICS WHEN PLAYING IF YOU WANT CD PROJEKT RED TO HOTFIX BUGS. This sends gameplay data anonymously to the devs for feedback. They cant fix bugs they don't know about.

Below are some of my opinions, if you care to read them:
*************
*** PROS: ***
*************
-There's freaking SWORDS
-There's freaking SWORDS coming out of your ARMS (if you choose to have them)
-Can own exotic cars and feel better about your average salary in real life
-You can literally have a vibrating dildo as a weapon (and it's actually pretty OP)
-You can literally run around with NO PANTS completely open and free for the world to see
-There are so many easter eggs and pop-culture references that I'm going to explode because I don't want to spoil anything
-HUGE map; lots to do, overwhelming number of side gigs to level up V and get those sicknasty perks/powerups
-Really good main storyline; immersive and fun, can be challenging at times
-There are a LOT of alternate endings, most are hidden achievements. Don't look into them if you don't want to spoil the game
-Ability to go stealth or guns blazing on missions (your pacifism gains you more money on gigs)
-AMAZING soundtrack
-Ambient noises/audio for this game are incredible
-LOTS of dialogue options for character development and relationships among NPCs you interact with (both major/minor characters)
-Verbose amount of guns, cars, etc. never bored of playing, lots of uniques

*************
*** CONS: ***
*************
(Bugs are listed after this section; these are general game cons)
-You literally need a quantum computer to run this game on ultra graphics
-There's no Mandingo penis size
-Bikes have the turning radius of a potato
-Can't do anything during a dialogue (e.g. trying to do a take-down while sneaking during a phonecall), resulting in being caught/killed
-There is no ""Craft X"" quantity of crafting materials. So if I want to make 1000 grenades, I have to click and hold the ""Craft"" button 1000 times
-There's no way to dismantle-lock/favorite a weapon, thus accidental dismantling of unique weapons or weapons you have equipped are more than possible. I have done it and wondered where my favorite gun went, unknowingly dismantling it for crafting parts
-Double-tapping A or D to dodge can be a bit annoying when trying to peer out from cover, or be very precise with movement, can accidentally dodge and fall off ledges, etc.
-Menus are a bit confusing at first and can be difficult to navigate when first starting out
-Minimap can be filtered, but the game does not remember the map filtering when you re-open it (frustrating when trying to bang out side gigs/NCPD tasks)
-The ammo counter on your HUD is very misleading. It is a four-digit counter (e.g. 0000 if empty). Max rounds are mid-triple digits for most classes (400-600). You can literally buy infinite ammo from stores without ever knowing your ammo count isn't going up. Misleading, needs to show max denominator (e.g. 0/450 if empty instead), and not allow players to buy ammo once they have max capacity
-The lore/readable datashards in the game are pretty much useless (besides mission-related datashards and some funny easter eggs). There are no achievements for collecting them, and there are excessive amounts of them scattered throughout Night City. I have gotten killed/caught on countless gigs/missions trying to collect these datashards, only to find out they have no real purpose (besides giving you something to read, if you're into that kind of gameplay). Causes a lot of clutter and makes it difficult to locate and decipher encrypted shards for missions.
-Path/mission/location trails on minimap may not be ideal route or may not accurately bring the player to where they are trying to go
-There are a handful of bugs/blips that make the game a bit aggravating, but it is still playable (see below)

*************
*** BUGS: ***
*************
==Constantly rebooting the game due to audio bugs; NPCs talking but no audio, no audio from car engines, no radio while driving, menus freezing, weapon/item info overlays not disappearing, drunk visuals never-ending, etc.
==The ""Killing in the Name"" quest, if you scan any of the routers during the 'scan the area' tasks, you will be unable to hack them as they will be listed as ""unpowered"", rendering them useless, causing players to revert back to old saves
==Dialogues occasionally take excessively long to end (e.g. hang up a phone-call but still cannot interact with menus/fast travel for ~1 minute). Additionally, some dialogues take excessively long times to load (will respond to an NPC and will not get an answer for some time, where it is blatantly obvious there is not meant to be a pause during the conversation)
==Floating objects (e.g. NPC's phone floating around their proximity rather than in their hand)
==NPCs sometimes 'glide' motionlessly while walking, rather than swinging arms/moving legs, etc., sometimes guns dont appear in your hands, causing you to be completely defenseless (and forcing you to re-load the game)
==Some incapacitated enemies remain standing after they are shot down or choked out, resulting in accidental killings (ruining the no-death optional tasks on side missions). This has not occurred very frequently, but still frustrating as it warrants reloading a save for the bonus money for no killing.
==Item pickup issues - have to be at same height as certain objects on shelves, tables, etc. in order to pick up. Had to abandon a few exotic items due to this, as I was unable to pick a sword up from its stand on a table due to being too low, etc. Very aggravating.
==Door opening issues (similar to the above item issues^) - menus for interacting with doors appear for a split-second then disappear, causing unnecessary delay while moving through areas, causing higher-risk of being caught by enemies during stealth missions. Remediation: crouching and standing up or moving away from the door then going back until the menu re-appears.
==You can occasionally get launched really high in the air when traversing walls, resulting in an instantaneous death when you land ('super jump')
==You can drive over people as if they are environmental objects, rather than running them over or plowing them out of the way
==^Cars often cannot drive over bodies; they get stuck, rendering the car completely useless
==Spawning a vehicle occasionally explodes instantaneously, or has maximum cosmetic damage when appearing
==Spawning a vehicle can run you over if you're standing near it when it drives up to you. CD PROJEKT RED should update this so the car stops before it reaches you, rather than drive 10-20m past your location
==Spawned vehicles can drive away from you, rather than toward you
==Spawned vehicles can drive in circles endlessly until you let them run you over/interrupt them so they stop
==Spawned vehicle location sporadic, often times very far away, takes a long time to get to you; inconvenient in a pinch",True
"I love this game, but i advise everyone to wait until it has it's bugs fixed before you buy it. This would be a far better game without the Bugs, Also the game reviewers hyped the game so much that it would not have mattered how good it was it would have never lived up to it's expectations. Glitches Include: NPC's walking/Running or floating around, NPC's being scared of a gun fight fight that is over. Also constant Game crashes (Seems to be worst with Story/Main Quests). These are the ones i have found so Far. Re: After doing this review i can no longer even start the game and when it starts it runs for less than 10 minutes, Please wait until it is fixed to Buy.",True

"[h1] Loving the game! [/h1]

Night city is absolutely beautiful! This is probably the most stunning environment I have ever seen in a game. Cruising through night city feels amazing because of the complexity, density and scale of the map. You might even call it breathtaking ;)

All jokes aside,

I just finished the main story and did about 15-20 side missions and I enjoyed every single moment! My favorite quests were the ones with Panam! She's the bomb! <3

Combat can be a bit underwhelming early on but gets a-lot better later in the game when you unlock more powerful weapons, armor and cyberware. There are also tons of awesome vehicles in Cyberpunk to discover! I really enjoyed driving on Jackie’s Arch and in Johnny's Porsche 911.

I feel like I barely scratched the surface of what Night City has to offer! I'm going to start a second play through to finish all side missions, get every obtainable item, go full legendary and complete all achievements! 

Sure it has some visual glitches, bugs and maybe some missing features but I'm sure CDPR will address and fix them in future updates.

Hardware used: Nvidia RTX 3080FE & Ryzen 9 5950X

TLDR: Awesome game which will get even better over time!",True
"There are some great things in this game. The ability to choose your own approach to doing quests. The hacking and core elements are all fun. Those choices quickly get old as you realize it's either go in guns blazing or stealthy with minimal if any dialogue variety or impact. The three life choices are irrelevant after 20 minutes. 

The story telling is forced down the player's throat. They don't show you much but tell you everything to the point it's grueling. 


From a world stand-point, the map is excellent. If it weren't for the hand-crafted AI that is brain-dead it'd be immersive. They took a well designed map and ruined it with deaf AI.

In a year this game will be on discount and have all/most the bugs fixed.

100%'d the game in 80 hours. Not worth.


TL;DR the core loop is okay. hacking is fun. the ai sucks. the story needs more. wait a year.",False
"This is definitely a game you need to wait for in order to get the best experience. Despite the multitude of issues, this is still something that I enjoy immensely. There are missions that will truly tug at you. The characters, especially ones like Panam and Judy, are really the shining stars of the entire experience. It is such a joy to live through the evolution of your relationships with them. The art direction, sound design and the actual Night City itself are beautiful. I am genuinely fearful for the end of the game at the point that I am at now, because I am invested in my V and her relationships and don't want to have to let her go. The gunplay and hacking mechanics are also solid and satisfying. However... 

Subpar performance (my PC is no slouch), buggy as hell, a lot of side quests are shallow and the game overloads you with so many. There are some truly bizarre gameplay decisions, like giving you a perk for throwing knives but you have to use your own (often expensive) knives and can't retrieve them. All enemies know exactly where you are and will continue to be aware of your position no matter how long you hide. NPC AI and police AI are virtually non existent, cars will patiently cause huge pileups if you have even a sliver of your tyre in their lane. The driving is floaty and car brakes are so terrible that you should really only be driving motorcycles. Your lifepath doesn't seem like it has much impact apart from some dialogue choices but I could be wrong, only played corpo so far. The post-lifepath intro montage was EXTREMELY underwhelming. 

Character appearance can't be changed past the initial CC screen, and your character more often than not has to look like a clown because of the clothing stats. You want to look good? Good luck finding pieces you like and scraping together enough upgrade components and money to continuously upgrade them. Where is the transmog system? Night City also feels kind of empty, most of the vendors cannot be interacted with, there are not even simple minigames to add a feeling of an interactive setting and the a lot of the side missions feel impersonal. It is also clear that CDPR cut A LOT of features when you compare the old demo footage and interviews to what is actually in the game. I've finished most of the side missions and still feels like it's a little too short. Not to mention the previous promise of no crunch, but then devs having to pull 100 hour work weeks. Where did management focus their efforts???

This game has all the ingredients to be a masterpiece, but it needed WAY more time in the oven. CDPR needs to optimize performance and squash bugs, but there are so many core features that also needs changing. Quite frankly, I don't know if they can change them, and how long people are willing to stick around to experience them. 

I love this game. I will continue to play the crap out of it and I want it to be better. I really hope it can be better.",False
"Played around 25 hours so far, and it feels like I've just barely scratched the surface of what the game has to offer. It could certainly be more optimized, but the game has been consistently smooth for me, with no FPS drops or lag. As far as bugs go I've also not seen any game-breaking ones, visual and/or audio bugs mostly, but this is stuff that can be fixed in future updates.

As for the game itself, I love it. Many people probably expected the Second Coming of Jesus Christ to be this game, and that made them feel disappointed - but I don't feel like my expectations were betrayed at all. The story is great, I love the characters, the soundtrack is epic, and the game looks great even on lower graphics options. And the atmosphere and setting are absolutely phenomenal - I've been having issues in focusing on quests since I just feel like walking around and exploring Night City.

I love it, and I look forward to many more hours in it - and to any DLC's and content that CDPR will make for it.",True

"I have been playing this game a lot since the release, because I bought the preorder, and after 36 hours I think it would be nice to give a review for this game.
---------------------------------------------
MY RATING: 8.7
---------------------------------------------
Introduction:
First of all, I bet you will say that I'm fucked in the head or I haven't played a good game before and that's why I gave Cyberpunk 2077 such a big score, but please just read below this little Introduction.

Story:
         Your name is V, and after a failed heist you get ""cybernetic cancer"", which is also a big rockstar named Johnny Silverhand. You can form bonds with a lot of people in the Night City and let them help you with your problem, or don't let them help you(it's your choice). I loved the story so much that I actually finished the game in 2 days. It's a good thing the developers make you choose between multiple endigs.

Side Quest:
         Side Quests, have beautiful stories, non-canon from the main story(the majority of them), and lets the player experience some of the things happening in the underground of Night City. 

Mechanics:
         In general, all mechanics are realised better than I expected exept, the melee combat and some of the cars driving, but that isn't a big issue with the game.

Bugs:
         I could talk a lot about them, but I don't think there is someone so bored that it will read the whole panel of Bugs. Yes, the developers don't have an excuse for being this many bugs, but at least they are trying to fix them so this is a plus for me.

I tried to make this review short, because I don't like writing much, but I hope you get what I mean in this review and maybe you will fall in love with this game as I did too.

",True
i love Farcry 6,True
"It's positive. Can't really name it a bad game, cmon guyz.",True
"I want to love this game, I want to be immersed in it's characters, story, quests. But I can't.

They promised a ""real open world"" or ""a change in the open world genre"", this game has the same gameplay as a FarCry.
Oh look, enemies to shoot, oh wow ""random encounters"".

I really hoped it would be a GTA killer or even better, what we got was a buggy mess. I watched hours and hours of reviews before buying it, i've watched everything CDPR released for building up the hype, and yea, I was really hyped for it. 

Im someone who likes grindy games, I have 500h+ in The Division 2 and over 100h in The Division 1, so the looter shooter idea worked with me. But this is not well implemented.

The really good thing about this game was a combat, at least the shooting. All the guns I have tested feels really good, and the combat is definetly the main part why I still play. The melee is aight, but OP even without leveling anything in the ""Blades"" skill tree. Im a huge fan of the ""Smart weapons"" and the ""Tech weapons"".

But my biggest issue with the game is the bugs, oooh god the bugs. I can't spend 10 minutes with a bug impacting my game. My game doesn't crash (fortunatly) but it has some really annoying bugs that just takes me out of the game and just makes me want to skim through it. I really hope it's going to get fixed in the future.

Im really annoyed of how much the game is getting praised and is getting positive reviews for a triple A game that is this much buggy. Even Fallout 4 is more stable then this game.

A lot of voice acting and animations are meh and sometimes really feel rushed.

The first 5 hour intro was really good, after, it was shit.

The more and more I play the game, the worst it get's. And the main story feels rushed at the end.

What pisses me off the most is that you can see the love put in this game, you really can, but the bugs ruins it.

Oh yea, please don't put stuff in your game that has no impact/use and that you use it just for marketing. ""Hey you can customize your dick haha, we have a quirky haha game"" I just don't understand why that is in the game, you can make a mature game without stuff like that and it will be good. 

Eh whatever, im sad, this game could've been an easy masterpiece. 

Fuck you shareholders",False
the game is awesome despite the really bad optimisation and some bug Cyberpunk still worth every dollars the game is really addicting and when you stop for a sec and take time to look at the amount of detail and love they've putt into it its amzing no the game is not perfect but which game is.,True
"Game seems alright, its fun, but its hardly revolutionary and doesn't come close to GTA in terms of open world or Witcher for its story. Overall, its just an Ok game, but id still take it over anything else that released this year.

+ Interesting theme, world and story.
+ Gunplay and combat  isn't too bad.
+ Keanu Reeves
+ Great main quest line so far
- First few hours of the game feels rushed as if they had planned to squeeze in a chapter but ran out of time.
- Poor performance/ frame rate, even with a high end PC its struggling.
- Some bugs and glitches.

If you're not rocking a high end GPU, hate 30fps gameplay and get your immersion blown by glitches, you may want to hold off.

Edit: 

After some more time playing, comparing this to even games like Mass Effect, Dragon Age, GTA, Fallout. This is probably more of a 6/10 in its current state. Maybe a generous 7/10 for the story and the visuals.

Whilst some bugs can be entertaining, some are game/experience breaking and others require a save reload. 

But hey it's still fun.",True
"As you propably know, It's a bit buggy, but otherwise a fantastic game.",True
"In its current state on Patch 1.04 its a hard NO. Dont buy it  unless you are ok with bugs and glitches, texture pop-ins and crashes. Core gameplay is good but expected for it to atleast be somewhat bug free. What a shame.",False
gamers are whiny crybaby subhumans so its no surprise people are complaining about the game not meeting their expectations. really enjoying this one. thx,True
"some bugs sure, but have you played fallout? seriously some of you idiots bought it 4 times. cyberpunk playslike  what fallout should have been had it been devolped by people concerned with good gameplay. 9.5/10",True
"It's ok, i didn't expect much from this game. And it felt really dull when i played it first time, but it started feeling a little better after i got used to all the performance issues, almost 'game breaking' bugs and the need to hang myself.. i mean it's a good game. But what the hell CD PROJEKT? Delayed this sh!t like three(?) times and it's still got a quite a bit of visual bugs and other.... i don't know the f4ck i have been experiencing. 

I have been randomly dying while jumping over things, or dropping down, i jumped over a damn fence and the game decided i didn't have permission to live anymore. And i have been seeing palm trees through the floor, and a guy sitting on the middle of the road while carrying other guy on his shoulders(this happened in the first 10 minutes) Don't know if that was bug or cd projekt's devs smoking somthin' while developing this sh!t show, but appreciate the good laugh. Hope it becomes a more stable experience later on.",True

"Have 10 hours so far and only two or three bugs (which could be solved by reloading my save from like two minutes ago - nothing special)

Game is really good. Wasn't super mega PogChamp hyped but after all it really catched me! 
(what Witcher 3 never did; mostly because the different game setting overall I think)

I would recommend to try the game by yourself and not get distracted by crying peoples left and right.

If u really want good FPS and graphics u need up-to-date hardware. (like really up-to-date)
For me 60-80 FPS is ok - all Ultra non RTX (cause I stream it on twitch; beside that I can play with RTX on @ around 80 FPS [DLSS performance]) ; RTX2080, i9 9900k, 16 GB DDR4 RAM",True

is very good

buy it,

now",True

reccomended for people who are in it for fun and don't mind a couple bugs for the first couple weeks",True
"The setting is awesome, the world is amazing and I will continue to play it, but right now and especially with the knowledge that they moved the release date a couple times, the game is still a mess with lots of bugs.

Some game design decisions, for example the clothing with the armor points and the bullet sponge enemies (even though the trailers show people being oneshot) are really killing the immersion/fun. 

Don't get me wrong, I will still play it and its fun, but right now I can't really give it a thumbs up and hope some stuff will be fixed.

Update after about 20 more hours since my first review:

- Gameworld, story and the overall ""art"" are really good. 
- Still lots of bugs, none gamebreaking for me so far. 
- Still think the clothing system the way it works is bad. 
- The bullet sponge enemies are still there in some parts, but with better weapons I can kill some people with one shot now. 
- The cops are this game are useless/broken. Could just remove them and no one would miss them. They either do nothing or spawn directly behind you and just annihilate you.",False
"More of a broken buggy mess than a game.  Everything feels unfinished.  I have played Alpha's that were more polished than this.

"Do I recommend the game? [b]No.[/b] Am I going to continue playing it in the state its in? [b] Yes.[/b]

I've been waiting 7 years for this game but right now, [b]this is an early access game that needed another year development[/b]. I'm not sure what game the reviewers were playing because giving this a 9 or 10/10 is ridiculous and is clearly based on CDPR's reputation. I'm sitting here baffled at why the fuck this game was released like this. CDPR clearly has no problems delaying the game, [b]is the state it's in apparently acceptable?[/b] Begs the question, what were they doing for the last 8 years cause half the game is missing.

Before I start, if you are left-handed or tend to rebind more than 3 keys then I hope you have a controller or the patience to dig into a config file to manually edit the bindings yourself. I use 'IJKL' as 'WASD' and I can rebind only one of them. For something so trivial and necessary, I hope this is beginning to show how this game needed another year in the oven.

The bugs are very distracting, completely ruins immersion, and please don't convince yourself that people complaining about the bugs are overreacting or that these people are unlucky and that you won't encounter nearly as many bugs--you will. NPCs will appear and disappear, fall out of the sky, stare at walls--they're clueless. If you shoot a bullet in the sky, every NPC in a 20m radius will simply drop to the ground and look panicked. They're brain-dead. If you block a road, cars will patently wait forever and create a long, long traffic jam. Oh you look one step into a restricted area? Prepare to be nuked from orbit. You can rob people blind and they'll stand there and couldn't give a fuck.

Half the advertised game is missing or is implemented in a bare-bones manner. Fast travel points are dotted around the map and is just a quick UI menu with a loading screen. The police are brain-dead and teleport to your location or can sense you through walls. A bunch of first-person animations just don't exist like eating, you just... consume. You can't change how V looks after starting the game, even the Witcher 3 had barbers but Night City apparently doesn't.

I hope you get the gist, just wait until the devs release the other half of the game.",False
"Personally I would recommend against buying the game at the moment it's an amazing game great storyline, awesome side missions that get me truly invested in the characters and make me care, awesome deep customization, massive world with tons of exploration to do and have fun with, lots of cool cars, weapons, and clothing to collect and the ability to build relationships, friendly and sexual with characters in the world, I love it HOWEVER this game has an unnacceptable number of glitches, I am not saying never buy the game, I am personally saying wait a month or 2 for the game to be patched and the bugs fixed before spending 60$, if you can look past the glitches and stuff (because they don't make it unplayable just a worse experience) then go ahead and grab it, I just can't recommend it to anyone while it's this buggy",False
"** Appologies for any grammar mistakes, english is not my main language **

So i played roughly 10 hours, and also watched the game for a while on Twitch. I chose to start out as a streetkid, followed the main story for the majority of the time. Occationally, i tried to dwell deeper into the world of cyberpunk. See whats going on in the city, study the AI, find out all the secret stuff, side missions etc. I must say, im abit underwhealmed.

Cyberpunk has by far one of the greatest and most emersive stories thus far in RPG games history. The universe that they have built feels good, interesting, fun and exiting. You feel that there is a great depth to this world, or atleast you feel that way until you start paying attention to details.

After playing for a while, i started to notice why this game was started upon in 2012. It feels inconsistent on wich era it is developed in. Some elements feels next-gen and some elements feels MASIVLY outdated! Take a random car explosion on the crowded streets of night city. The AI will scatter, and start to sprint in the same running animation, in weird direction that makes no sence.

The AI feels clunky overall, and it only takes a few minutes to notice the same NPC model, 4-5 times on the same sidewalk. Talking to the normal civilians doesnt give you anything. There arent many voicelines to go trough, and you dont get much ""fun and exiting"" dialog between you or other NPC's that arent intertwined into a storyline.

Graphics is another thing. The ray tracing is AMAZING on certain locations at certain times. And you really feel that the graphics are really next-gen. But then you have things that looks like they come straight out of sims 2, that just doesnt hold up to date. Its very inconsistent! And for a game that is this badly optimized, and demands such amense of CPU/GPU power, you would think that the game would really be fully next-gen on ultra settings. Its not.

At best, this game is close to next-gen, at worst its like a game for 2008. On avarage, i would say Skyrim easily can compete with Cyberpunk on the graphical part. Me beeing a massive fan of the GTA franchise, i like to pay attention to the NPC's, what they are doing, they're pathing, the dialogs and their behavour. Cyberpunk's AI is as bad as Watch-dogs (1)'s AI, and thats bad for a 2020 game.

The gunplay is fantastic, though some of the weapons are hard to understand. The RPG element is fantastic, and is set up so that you would have to replay this game ALOT of times to try out ALL of the different skill-builds and storylines. The driving in this game is ""meh"", its okey i guess. Movement feels clunky. Stealth is confusing, and i still fail to see how you can play this game 100% stealth mode. I allways tried to go stealth in my playtrough, but i allways end up either getting noticed by the enemies, or i fail to figure out how to proceed without shooting the guy infront of me. The UI can be confusing at first, but i guess with time, you get used to it. Some of the gameplay are really dull, repetetive and boring. I will only say ""BD""... Boring as hell.

I feel like, if i was gonna say more, i would have to go into specific details about characters or places/times in the storyline and break them down AKA spoilers, wich i wont. So ill just end the review with a quick 1/10 rating on different elements of the game. For ratings sake, lets say that Skyrim at the time it came out, was a 9/10 RPG game.

Graphics: 6.5/10 (Too inconsistent for todays standard)

Performance: 5/10 (Impossible to play this game above 60FPS on ultra with high-end PC, and rubberbands if you stream it)

UI: 6/10 (Not the most practical design, but you get used to it)

AI: 5/10 (Feels massivly outdated. Specially civilians. Enemies are quite dumb and without logic too.)

Map/Universe: 8/10 (Huge map, lots of details, lots of story to read, listen and play trough. Though, lots of areas you think you woul be able to go to/in are inaccesable, wich sucks.)

Storyline: 9/10 (You get really into the story, and at times i feel like im watching/playing a good sci-fi movie)

RPG elements: 9/10 (There are SOOO many skills and builds in this game, you have to play it over and over and over)

Gunplay: 7/10 (Its okey, not much else to say.)

Melee: 5/10 (If you played Skyrim and The Witcher. Dont go Melee in this game, go with guns. You will be dissapointed)

Stealth: 6/10 (Im either really bad, or the stealth in this game is near impossible)

Characters: 8/10 (Interesting characters you can fall in love with.)

Acting: 8/10 (Some actors are abit stiff. Specially my man Keanu, but its allright overall!)

Content: 9/10 (Best part of this game, is the ammount of content you get. This game will give you PLENTY of hours to kill. So if you want alot of hours for your $$$, this is the game for you.)

Polished/Bugs?: 5/10 (Buggy as hell. You WILL die to bugs... ALOT... Atleast at the current build of the game. I've died around 5 times in my 10 hours of gameplay, beeing launched out of some stairs, glitched trough the ground etc).

Overall: 6.9/10

the only glitch i encountered was on day 1. i was killed and my save game was broken and wouldn't load. so i had to start over from scratch.. having to create my character features again after 2 hours of play. this is the second day of playing and it's glitch-free and runs beautiful for me. my game is being saved successfully and i'm so happy about that.. because i die a lot lol. i hear a lot of players are having issues or disappointed with the game. for me.. i love this game. it's better than fallout.. better than red dead redemption.. better than a lot of games in my library. i have waited for this game for 15 months and i am not disappointed. i'm glad i bought it. i give my faith to the developers. i feel this game will only get better and i can't wait for multiplayer. i will ride this game out and see where it goes. 2 thumbs up for me.,True

"This game is pretty solid. Unlike other rpg style games such as Assassins Creed Odyessey, Cyberpunk really keeps me interested and wanting to play everytime i wake up. There are some bugs though such as cigs just floating in the air during talking scenes, the problem of moving incredibly slow and having to restart the game.
Another bug is also after the mission 'talk to viktor'. after completing the mission it is still there and confused many players including me who spent a lot of time figuring it out. 
The 'openworld' doesnt exist until later in the story which is around 5-8 hours into the game which is quite some time, but with the story and all it isn't so bad.

"Updating after 45 hours and completing the main story and lots of side stories as well.

1. Great storytelling & character, good variety of side missions although does get boring after a while. Kept me hooked enough for me to sink 45 hours into it in 3 days.
2 Good gameplay, okay-ish driving & shooting, hacks are fun tho
3. Buggy af, although 1.04 patch did fix a lot of them, not all. Still can't figure out why the surfaces look grainy as hell even on ultra preset and high texture resolution
4. Character customization was a complete let down - the visual side of it. The cybernatics are okay but atleast put some body size/ height sliders atleast. Marketed it so much but got a pretty lackluster one, even skyrim kicks it's ass when it comes to customization.
Clothes are fucked up- I made a female character with small chest and they blow up like balloons when she's wearing clothes like seriously wtf atleast respect the customization decision if you're gonna put them there
5. Lackluster world/npc interaction. Such a large world but so little interactions. Such a shame.
6. Loot system is really bad and distracting.
7. Lack of vehicle and apartment customization, and things to spend money on apart from weapons/clothes/vehicles .What do I even do with all these money?
8. Police and gangs are almost non existent. Was hoping more interaction with the gangs given the marketing, but sadly there are none apart from a few of them during the main story.
9. Can't use braindances outside story missions. I even got a vendor selling rare bds but what's the point if you can't even use them
10. Very little impact of your lifepath on the story, only a few small dialogues here and there.
11. And finally, didn't really feel like a rpg. Has a few different endings and that's it.

There are plenty more to add but I'm feeling lazy. So, disappointed? Kinda. CDPR couldn't deliver what they promised, it felt like the release of no man's sky, big hype and lots of promises but failed to deliver on so many aspects. It's still a great game, just not what I expected Right now the game feels like any other standard open world game, not the revolutionary open world rpg we were hoping for. . Feels like CDPR could've really used another few years of time to give us what we really wanted - the game felt rushed and incomplete. It lacks some incredibly basic rpg & open world elements.

High difficulty just means enemies takes more shots to kill that's all it seems to change. 1 stealth kill animation in the entire game. Can't rebind buttons on controller and even on KBM they're limited. Can't change character size ur stuck as a short anorexic the entire game. No walk toggle on pc awful for immersion.

Throwing knives don't 1 hit they do barely any damage why even put them in the game. ""Instant death"" bug killing you if you walk over a rock in the wrong way. Crafting menu is awful, you will never have the required skills or perks/items required to make anything good until well after the main quest is over unless you abuse exploits.

even tho i played it for more than 40 hrs right now, this game runs smoothly on my rig at 1080 (didn't want to force it at 2k or even 4k or 8k, well you need NASA computer, lol). there's some stories made me cry man (idk maybe i'm too soft as a Man), but yeah if you pick your ""words"" in this game so carefully, those words had a impact - even for the side quest.

"Alright listen up, maybe I'm blinded by my own fanboyism but listen, I've waited for this game like.. seven years. I was still eating tomato sauced breads my mom was makin' when I got back from the middle school, and watched Ghost in the Shell freshly when I've seen this game's trailer. By this game's trailer I met Witcher 3 and CDPR. 

So far in the seven years; I finished middle school, got forcibly gave up on fine arts high school and moved on from a different path, caught on hypothermia and almost died, had many fistfights, parents divorced, again caught upon an illness which is a permanent stress-based urticeria, had my first gf and broke up very sadly, with other bittersweet memories I finished high school too, then three years in university too with also a few worse things I'd probably not mention.

In these seven years did I anticipate so much from this game? Hell yes. I really wanted this game to become ""the cyberpunk rpg experience of decades"" but you know what, I still don't mind the bugs and performance stuff I'm and he's having right now. I'm even glad that they didn't decided to cancel or completely overhaul/change the game (though I recall this game was originally intended to have a MaxTec arc-ish main story) and still did deliver this one. I'm sure, and helluva sure they're gonna patch or fix this game for the best. Yeah, they could do better. But if you did have a ""soft place"" in your heart for this game, I'm sure you'll still forgive. I did, and I goddamn enjoyed this game even for 2 hours. And I'm playing with 45 FPS or something with 1050Ti Ryzen 5? Yeah probably.

Whatever it takes, this game will have a really, really special place in my heart, and I'm so glad I finally got to see these days..

"A GAMING MASTERPIECE THAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO PLAY
(no spoilers review)


With 131 hours played (as of now), I think I'm fairly experienced to share my review.

Things I loved:

- Story
Blown off. Was gutted by the ending and made me rethink some life choices. There's also a bunch of amazing side quests. Many tough choices, deep thinking, lots of consequences. The detailed writing, the variety of outcomes, the feedback after completing a quest, the scenery, weather, music in them... There's definitely some Witcher vibes and you can easily tell this is CDPR we are talking about. 
The connection you establish with the characters is real. Thanks for all the touching memories.

- Visuals
Arguably the best looking game at the moment. I don't think anything is even remotely close to the beauty of Night City. I've spent countless hours just driving around and gazing at its beauty. Not a single corner felt boring. First person camera in the car, Jazz radio, night time - that's how I rolled. I cannot get enough of this city and everything they did with it. Mornings and their beauty with mesmerizing sunshine, rainy afternoons with drops rolling on the windshield. The most beautiful city I've been into, both in real and virtual life.


- Sound/audio
Breathtaking. The composers outdone themselves with this one. Background music was not overwhelming but you can feel it's always there. Radio's quite diverse with tons of music. In my 80 hours, I could still hear new songs that I haven't heard before, and I listen to all the stations. Dubstep, jazz, metal, rock, techno, hip hop... you name it.
The guns sound very realistic (not that I'd know lol). You can feel that big BANG when the bullet comes out. I loved those sounds.
The car sounds are incredible!! I've never heard more realistic sounding cars in game. You can feel the tires on the cement as if the car's outside your home. Holy sh!t that engine sound ROARS!


- Gameplay
Different and complex in a positive way. Many paths to pick, but you can mainly go with whatever floats your boat. You can start with a handgun, but lean towards hacking. Go melee or stealth, or both, or maybe all of it at once. A lot of choices and I don't think you can go wrong with any. Super-excited to a try a completely new build in my second playthrough. Driving is different (needs some getting used to) but totally worth it. My highlight was the freedom to parkour Night City. Immense verticality and freedom to explore which is often rewarded. 



Thinks I didn't like / can be improved:

- some minor to medium bugs in my experience. Had only one side quest that couldn't finish because of a bug, still can't. Main quest was flawless.
- a walk button for sure. An always-running V did not fit in most situations
- zoom out radar when you're driving fast. Many missed turns because you simply have no time to react
- Trauma Team could have been utilized more. Almost not present at all, but hopefully in a future DLC
- only ONE cat to be pet :( 
- an ability to change your look/style mid game
- the AI of the Police feels like a placeholder and needs improvement 
- some AI improvement on the pedestrians and traffic in general
- could have more scopes, muzzles, but that's just nitpicking I guess


To summarize:

This game made me Wow a million times. Coming from a GTX 1060 to a RTX 3070, I could not believe that games have progressed this far. A real masterpiece that everyone should play (preferably on a high-end PC for now). Memorable quests, characters, experiences, places.

A quite ambitious approach to a game, but in my opinion a successful one with room for improvement. Just don't believe anything you read on the internet and if you get a chance to play it, try to form your own opinion of it.

A well-deserved 10/10 from me and you too should try for yourself and figure your own opinion. Me? I cannot wait for future updates, DLC's, whatever stuff they have planned.

Thank you for this masterpiece CDPR.

Until next time.",True

"TLDR: Don't buy the game for what CDPR said would be in the game, buy the game (after the 1.2 patch) for it's story.

Note that this is [b]NOT[/b] the game that CD Projekt Red has marketed to you for the past 8 years. Plenty of things that CDPR mentioned are just not present, and they definitely should be held accountable for that.

However, I would recommend this game based on the game alone, minus all the drama surrounding the game. CDPR have made a story that kept me interested all the way to the end, and the many side characters you meet along the way each have their own arc they go through which i found amazing. It's a shame those side missions are buried along dumb 'gigs' that just say: ""Go kill this person who did this thing"". There should really be a distinction between these hand-crafted side missions and ordinary gigs.

If you do plan to purchase the game, I would suggest waiting until the game receives it's 1.2 patch.",True
"Not worth buying, even the story is super short!",False
"Despite the bugs, I'd say it's an overall good game. I never gave into the huge hype the game had, so I'm not really that disappointed. If you can get the game to run (and at a stable frame rate), I'd say give it a go. I enjoyed the story and the side missions, the characters were neat and I enjoyed the gameplay - although it was buggy and glitchy at times. Sound would become choppy, framerate would drop from 60fps to mid-20s seemingly at random, but it usually fixed itself or a restart would do the trick. That said, they still need to definitely patch the game - my friend has a computer that should be able to definitely run the game, but he can't get anything above 20FPS, which basically makes it unplayable. If you're having FPS options and have an RTX Card, I would recommend trying the DLSS option on in the graphics settings if you haven't already, that boosted my FPS from ~45 to ~60. In terms of content, it is disappointed when I read through what was shown and/or promised in trailers and whatnot, but as I said, it's still a good game nonetheless - maybe these will eventually be added in through updates or DLC, who knows.

Besides the FPS, I'd say the most frustrating thing I encountered was that I originally was hoping to go for a 100% completion save, but one of the little police sidequest things bugged out, and even though I had defeated the enemies and completed the area, it still showed up on the map and said it wasn't completed, and unfortunately I hadn't noticed that until I had already moved on, made new saves, etc. Another thing I find frustrating - and I'm not sure if it's a bug or intentional, but: (Endgame Spoiler BTW): [spoiler] Apparently there's a ""secret ending"" with Johnny Silverhand - but your relationship has to be at 70 by the time you get to the endgame mission, or you won't get it. I, and seemingly the vast majority of players, end the game with 60 relationship (even though I was nice and agreeable to Johnny for the majority of the game and did all his sidequests...) - but you can apparently also get the ending with 50 relationship? I'm not sure if that's a bug or intentional but... it's a little disappointing, as I was going for all the endings, and was able to get them all besides that one - which would now require me to make a new save and play all the way through, sucking up to ole Jonathan every step of the way it seems.[/spoiler]",True

"[h1] What I WISH Cyberpunk was: [/h1]
A truly open-ended RPG. You can create anyone and [i]be[/i] anyone. You, the player, can set your own ambitions and the choices you make in the game would directly reflect who you’re trying to role play. 

Your life path is more apparent in-game, beyond just the opening and certain dialogue. The game actually branches off into different paths and your choices make a difference in the beginning and middle - not just the end. Your choices have impact that also reflects onto the world itself as you play.

You get to purchase homes/apartments, customize them, visit futuristic autoshops to customize your cars with interesting and useful gadgets or cosmetics, enter a coffee shop and watch as NPCs go on with their lives - maybe bump into unique interactions with them, walk into a casino and play your hand in a futuristic version of poker, come across different activities that you wouldn't see in the modern world, different means of transportation like subways or flying cars to get a vantage view of the city, entering a clothes shop and actually visually trying on different clothes.. To have the opportunity to set yourself in this world and truly immerse yourself by having the chance to do what otherwise would seem as mundane tasks, but have it become interesting because of the futuristic setting. This sort of detail would create an environment and a bustling city with substance - and one that’d be worth returning to. 

I would’ve hoped for a more dynamic level of detail where, for example, you would have a greater chance of stealth during nighttime or you’d get dirty after hours of missions while neglecting showering/resting. I never had a reason to enter my apartment, so why not give the players a reason to? These little realistic details & dynamics would only add to the immersion. It was surprising to me that that level of detail was lacking from developers like CDPR.

I’d love to see droids interacting with the world and other NPCs, walking the streets, being vendors and interesting characters/quest-givers, etc. There was only a taste of this with the AI taxi service in-game. It would've been neat to see more innovative uses of tech scattered throughout the world that could demonstrate the difference in everyday life compared to the present. I feel the game didn’t take enough advantage of its setting to better showcase a futuristic city. 

A smart law enforcement system, where being issued a warrant actually means you have to be wary of running into police officers in certain parts of the city and have to give effort in evading the police. There should’ve also been different means of dealing with the law (bribes, surrender, resisting, getting caught and imprisoned, etc.) and those different means could be dependent on your role-playing builds and attributes. Instead I feel as though I can get away with anything and a short drive around the block will clear my name. Where’s the depth? 

I could go on about the different features that could've truly enhanced this game... And a lot of what I wished for is actually also what CDPR also promised. A huge chunk of these promises were far from fulfilled though. 

[hr][/hr]

[h1]What we got:[/h1]
An interesting and good story, decent enough combat/stealth, but with everything else falling at or well below average. Fix the bugs and this review will likely still stand. I'm more concerned by the fundamental aspects of the game... If this description doesn't change, my opinion will stand. 

V’s ambition is mostly their own. If you aren’t interested in “becoming a legend of night city” and, for example, you chose Nomad because you’d actually prefer to be an outsider - Well, you don’t have much role-playing say. Remember, you’re not playing your own character. You’re role playing V. That version of V still has the same goal in mind no matter where you come from or what you’re actually interested in. The only time you’ll be able to express the sort of direction you want to head, it’s at the very end when you simply choose between the different endings. 

“Branching storylines” is nothing more than just choosing between multiple different endings. You unlock more endings simply by doing a few key quest lines... That’s it. There wasn’t any impactful decision up until the very end. This takes any replayability away from the game. Just replay the last mission and you saw everything. There's no reason to replay anything else.

You can't pay attention to NPCs too much or it'll break immersion. They don't have their own daily routines, they walk in circles and get scared by you simply jumping onto a railing. Law enforcement AI is especially horrible, instantly spawning on you and not really posing any challenge either. NPCs do a lot to a game's environment and immersive-ness, it would need an entire rework to fix.

I know the game is meant to be dystopian, but that doesn’t mean Night City needed to be so distasteful. It’s empty, trashy, and unpleasant. I wouldn’t want to set foot in that city in real life. I personally don’t think it really captures the vibe of “cyberpunk” either. Cyberpunk’s world isn’t much of a sandbox. It’s not really the game you’d start up to just to mess around in, simply because there isn’t really anything to do aside from the missions/gigs... Unlike a game like GTA or RDR2, where the worlds are entertaining enough on their own. TW3 was good in that regard as well, so why are we taking steps backwards? Those aforementioned worlds were filled with detail and unique interactions/encounters. You were bound to run into something you haven’t seen before even after hours of gameplay, which made those worlds worth exploring.  I never felt compelled to do that in Cyberpunk, and when I did decide to explore anyways, it just reminded me of the lack of substance within Night City. That sandbox/exploration aspect to the world was just missing and, to me, that was both surprising and disappointing.

Military and intelligent taxi droids are there, but why not drones who could sweep the city, for example? The city could sure use it & surely they would’ve have had that sort of technology in the future. Again, it doesn’t feel like the future setting was fully taken advantage of. There could’ve been so much to see and experience in this setting.. There was definitely more room to see technological advances in play.

The game felt void and heavily relied on its short story to keep the interest. If the story is the only thing you value, this should be enough for you. CDPR are good story writers. I just hoped for something more and I don't think it's unfair to say that as CDPR promised a difference experience. 

[hr][/hr]

[h1]Verdict:[/h1]
Perhaps it's at CDPR's disadvantage that I and many others hold them to a higher standard because of their past work. At the same time, I do believe the developers envisioned the game I described in the first half of this review, but for whatever reason(s), it wasn’t delivered. There were so many promised features lacking that it stripped the depth and detail I was expecting. The game to me is just another average open world game now, but with a story that’s above that average. I couldn’t say the experience was unique or amazing, it was just fun and good enough to finish through. You’re not missing out on a whole experience, so I wouldn’t go out of my way to recommend this game. I wouldn't outright discourage it either however, I’d only suggest to wait for more patches and/or sales. There's no need to rush. I would've likely given this game a neutral rating, if Steam had that option, otherwise I would only truly recommend the game that CDPR promised.

In short, if you told me you haven’t played Cyberpunk 2077, I wouldn’t react with “What?! You haven’t played Cyberpunk?!”. 
I wish that wasn't the case.",False
"DISCLAIMER: obviously, I haven't finished the game. This review is based on my current experience. I may edit it in the future.

RTX 3080 and i7 7700k owner here. Cyberpunk is installed on a SSD.  I only had one serious bug in my first 13 hours play time.  The game runs smoothly (50-60fps) on 4K high + RTX + DLSS for the most parts. Oddly enough, most of my big framerate drops happened not during combat or while racing in the heart of the city, but during conversations with NPCs.

I'm aware some people have much bigger problems with the game. I cannot be certain, but I feel like most technical issues are related to hardware. The game seems unable to run correctly on some outdated rigs. What I recommend is: make sure your system is up to date (especially GPU) and install the game in a SSD.

From my early experience, the story is nicely written. You will likely see some plot twists coming, but nothing stupid happens. NPCs are reliable and not forgettable. You also have Keanu Reeves as your JoJo stand. What could be better? However, I'm not sure our choice matters that much, at least in the beginning.

Night City really feels immersive and is a lot detailed. This is way above ""classic open"" world games experience such as GTA or even The Witcher 3. To be honest, it feels more like Deus Ex, which is on a way smaller scale. On the other hand, some civilians can act really weird. Once I bumped into someone and everyone freaked out like I killed him and eat his corpse. Some people can also become hostile with no apparent reason. Fortunately, this is quite rare.

Gunfights are enjoyable and you have many options when it comes to how to kill your enemies.

EDIT: After playing a bit more, I started to notice some issues when it comes to driving. While the experience is greet overall, crashes are disappointing (the car is not really wreaked and you're not really hurt) and it seems the police will never chase you once you get in a car. So, no car chase. Really, CD Project?

"[h1] Overview: [/h1]
As much as I love the story and characters so far, I absolutely cannot recommend this today for its full pricetag. I'm sure after many many different patches are added months from now, the game will be in a better state. Once many of the issues are fixed, I will absolutely recommend it. For now, I'd say wait patiently until the game's optimized and CDPR has done something about the atrocious ""Open World"" because by that time it will hopefully be on sale and have the upcoming DLCs bundled with it. 

[h1] Graphics/Performance: [/h1]
Surprisingly, I haven't run into any game breaking bugs (yet). There are a few immersion breaking bugs every now and again with NPCs phasing through objects, cutscenes with background dialogs, etc. It's not fully optimized for Ultrawides as a few of the menus/user interfaces clip out every now and again but its still does a good job if you're running in 21:9. I'm able to run this game at MAX settings (no ray tracing) in 1440p (2560x1080) and get anywhere between 40-70 fps with an i7+1080ti. The main settings I immediately had to turn off were Motion Blur, Chromatic Aberration, Film Grain, Lens Flair, Zoom Sensitivity, and Additive Camera Motions. The game looks absolutely amazing and plays great even at sub-sixty fps because, in my experience, the sub-sixty frames were steady instead of random drops/inclines and eased their way back up to 60+ fps. Usually only happened in huge areas with huge crowds and vast amounts of environmental textures. If you have lesser hardware, you'll just have to turn down your settings. There are occasionally rendering glitches where certain textures take longer to load or they might deload but I didn't notice it too often. As long as you're playing on outdated above-average hardware or current average hardware, you shouldn't have too big of issues getting this to run at stable framerates. I'm upset with CDPR marketing this ready for consoles as this game struggles more than any other game I've played with this hardware (and its above average for PC, let alone console!) I do truly feel for console players though, I couldn't begin to even imagine trying to run this on the next gen PS5/Xbox Series X. I wouldn't subject this game to a PS4 or an Xbox One unless I wanted to set the thing on fire. 

[h1] 10 Hour Impressions: [/h1]
The narrative, story-based gameplay, cutscenes, dialog writing, voice acting, music, and characters in this game are all very good. The character customization wasn't as in-depth as I was hoping it to be but they still did a very good job with character creation compared to most games (though it seems the NPCs have more diverse customization options for some reason?). The deal breaking problem for me is the open world, lack of NPC AI, and the absolutely game-breaking crime system. [b] The crime system is an absolute joke and would be laughed at even if it were in an early access title, let alone a finished product that's been delayed so many times it causes PTSD when you see the color yellow. [/b] It will take many many months to fix this because it appears (at least to me) that absolutely no effort went into the crime system at all during production. It's one of the biggest and most important parts of an open world sandbox where you commit crime and it punishes the player so bad that it makes the player never want to explore said sandbox or even make a mistake by aiming weapons or accidentally running over someone (using the game's very sloppy driving). [b] When one of the main selling points of your game is Open World and you slap halfbaked NPC interactions, no vehicle or NPC AI, and a horrendous crime system, I'm going to feel quite a bit ripped off. [/b] I'm surprised to say this because I admit that I thought they would show the rest of the game developers ""how it's done"" but they really need to take some notes from Rockstar/GTA/RDR when it comes to their open world because that was one of the features I was greatly looking forward to, only to have my dreams of going on massive crime streaks and mass slaughtering innocent NPCs ruined. :'(

[h1] 22 Hour Impressions: [/h1]
I'm really really digging the soundtrack and especially the radio's music- even more than tracks that play on my IRL radio. <3 Unfortunately my luck has run out and I've begun running into more and more glitches, gamebreaking ones this time. :( I haven't found a way to recustomize my character yet in a world based around body modifications... The choices you make don't seem affect major outcomes/main story or character relations which has been a really big disappointment. I chose to be a Corpo and I have yet to see how that choice made an impact on the story, it only gave me dialog options. I feel as though I could have chose any (Nomad, Street Kid, or Corpo) and it wouldn't have made any difference besides the first few starting minutes of the game. You can get even more dialog options based on your attributes but I haven't found it to be meaningful. I also tried reloading saves to see if there are different dialog trees and it seems that you have the same options/outcomes (95% of the time) regardless of the dialog choices you make. Inventory management/looting system could be better but it's decent enough. I'm really liking the skill trees and crafting aspects of the game so far. Once you begin leveling your character through side quests and getting enough street cred, the game begins to let you customize your experience using the different trees and upgrades which is very fun. The side quests are actually pretty meaningful/eventful. It's not just crappy filler, it's good content. I'm still sticking to the fact that the best part of the game is your questlines because the Open World aspect of the game has gotten worse the more I play with it. I notice NPCs performing animations with things that have been destroyed, map clipping/phasing through objects, terrible pathfinding, prescripted events, lack of dynamic physics, insane overkill fall damage at random times, lack of diverse shops, world feels uninteractable outside of the story, little to no self customization, rail based driving, sooo many unopenable doors, swimming/water sim feels really outdated, nothing to truly discover outside of your side quests, and so much more. I'm afraid of this game having zero replayability once I complete the rest of the main story and side missions. [b] However, I've had a blast with the amount of time I've played during the story and that has alone been worth it to me but I still would recommend waiting for either the open world to massively improve or for the game to be on sale with the DLC. [/b]

[h1] Final Thoughts: [/h1]
As many issues this game has, I've begun to think that it wont ever actually be remedied because a lot of the systems needed for a better open world experience are non existent and would require CDPR to implement [i] entire new features [/i] on a game that's already been released. The questline/story is very good for what it is but it's not the entire reason I bought the game. I bought it for the RPG elements, enticing story, choices mattering, and most importantly the [b] Open World. [/b] It only manages to deliver on the enticing story and RPG elements for me. Unlike the endless possibilities of an Open World RPG where you can shape the outcome and explore many different paths, it's moreso a fun linear action game sprinkled with a few RPG elements. The game plays like a quest point to point game that lets you roam and explore the map whenever you're not doing quests. This game has gotten insane praise from video game reviewers and journalists which I feel is completely unwarranted but it's still a good game nonetheless (if you can get it to run). I'll be looking forward to the Crowbcat video that documents how sloppy of a launch this turned out to be because this game definitely needs some work to deliver to the hype (which it's totally capable of doing!).",False

Amidst complaints, I had no gaming breaking bugs so far but a dozen ridiculous glitches that I never had before the first hot-fix. Most problems on games today are due console downgrade, and the PC hardware compatibility situation. A.I. is excellent during action but I admit they can glitch. Now don’t confuse bug with poor design, the pedestrian NPC are just dumb, just there to look good. If this was a buggy mess, say like ME:A or Fallout 76 I would totally wreck this game.

[h1][b]What pleases me the most[/b][/h1]

[b]The guns, cars and fights[/b]

The guns really are cyberpunk and I still can find new rare ones. They’re very satisfying to use, from baseball bats, to pistols and Sniper rifles - there are even tech weapons, the “laser gun” from the future, some with fun sound effects somewhat inspired by movies like Terminator. When you take a revolver, assuming it has available slots then it’s Blade Runner time. Place a scope on it and a silencer to pull the job like a cyber ninja, or perhaps in blazes of glory, then just grab the big guns with critical mods. I like to stick with pistols and Submachine guns and hand-to-hand combat and Katanas, melee fights are super fun and well composed to play with. Things like smart-guns can fire shots after the target even behind cover like that movie The 5th Element, this is how you can apply experience perks to interact with cyber implants. All that violence and you can avoid killing too, eventually impacting future missions. I personally like to avoid killing the Animals ‘cause I luv them and Maelstrom whenever possible.

The retro futuristic cars are just like the 80s perceived the future, exaggerated and ultra violent. I like how the game is reserved around the types of speed and guns, no rocket launcher and no idiotic stunts missions. Cyberpunk 2077 could easily become a fast-food open world and this isn’t really the game's intentions - this is an audacious plot based open world. Do not believe short opinions, free roam isn’t a GTA fantasy forcing you to acquire secret tokens in an onramp. Only the rich can have their “flying cars” and when you’re in one is context based. Road cars range from Mad-Max to Judge Dredd, specially trucks old futuristic art design with sick sound effects.

[b]The powers, girls and boys[/b]

This is a [b]RPG[/b] however, your readiness before every fight is crucial, so don’t underestimate the A.I. enemies because they can be really smart especially on harder difficulties. The use of tactical hacking unit interface will be used frequently to disarm cameras, enemy armor, robots and guns, even if you just want to shoot you still have to get creative. There is the possibility to stay away from further cyber implants, this way you don’t need to worry about netrunners uploading Daemons (hostile viruses and countermeasures). You can stay pretty much human, severely impacting the gameplay. 

Romance is limited to a small set of characters but I guess that’s for balance sake; some are gay, some are hetero and I found a pansexual (detective River) yet it is hard to “wait” for your other options. Romance events are well written, but the way you keep them after that is a little bit vague, they keep contacting you via message but nothing else. Romance is just to work the plot, not really a GTA:SA girlfriend thing. Sex scenes are hot and arousing due high quality direction, not just some pornhub mediocre slaughterhouse quality.

Boxing, racing, they are all mission dependable. It is quality over quantity, it is immersion over trigger-happy. But there is a downside to it, there is no mini-game like a Gwent. Lots of places that could have been used for such activities are only there to look good. Once an activity is done through a mission, you won’t do it again. Favorite activities so far [spoiler]were Playing with River’s siblings simulation and racing with Claire. Rhino, an “Animal” girl I spared showed up in the final boxing match just to boost my spirit. [/spoiler] Not just your friends got personality or beauty… potential villains like Meredith or the Peralez can also trigger delicious events too.

[b]The art and the design[/b]

Action music is intoxicating like a good drug rush, cinematic music in cutscenes are pure immersion perfection. The city looks like a gigantic nostalgia while still very original in its own ways. Some places are degraded in acid slums like any dystopia, while the super futuristic streets look like gigantic toys around the rich areas. Advertising is EVERYWHERE and they’re all ridiculous, 99% of them suggests ʀᴇᴛᴀʀᴅᴇᴅ sexism just to buy a can of soda in a beautifully degenerated consumist dystopia. Gangs run the streets, if you take a passive ride on your car you can see it happening on the window everywhere. Take action or don’t.

[b]Storytelling is where this game is really good at[/b]

This is the most immersion intense game and with it comes many feelings underwater. You’d be drowned in shock and awe, saddest tears, ridiculous laughs, sexual arousing, intense rage and much more. Excellent writing, characters psychology and cutscenes are intensified by first-person perspective, making it another life in another world. Voice acting and body - including Keanu Reeves and many other unpopular actors and actresses were incredible artists. V’s best friend Jackie and others like Panam and the Aldecaldos clan were the most captivating ones, someone you’d like is definitely somewhere in there. A friend of mine LOVES detective River’s just so you know.

It is impossible to resist even if you’re not up for immersion, the mind is at risk of being kidnapped by addiction. So many moments look like your own real life events, the human touch is really boots on the ground. Now… I gotta talk about Johnny Silverhand, the character has a pristine design that works like a joker card, it is funny and hateful and worrisome at best, constantly trying to convert on your progress. The programmers behind all that will never have the recognition they truly deserve because Hollywood won’t ever respect games as developed art. 

At least they got paid.

[h1][b]What really pisses me off[/b][/h1]

[olist][*]Dash to parry often happens when you don’t want to, ruining stealth.
[*]You will be constantly forced to stand up when you’re crouching.
[*]Mini-map is confusing crazy and lacks zoom-out option.
[*]There is no toggle-to-walk key for keyboard users.
[*]Keyboard users need more love and a Witcher 3 treatment.
[*]Trailers had some features that never made it to the release.[/olist]

V is pretty much a solo merc to free roam the city, I was expecting the game to be companion based, no recruitable companions like most RPGs do. I know this is for the plot sake yet that’s a big downer for me just like the vague post-romance. I can only hope to see those things on future DLCs to pacify my expectations.

"This may just be the best video game story I've ever experienced, but my only real complaints about it is that it's extremely too short and I think there could be some extra dialogue options cause I felt like there was some things that could be said that I couldn't pick to say at times.

As for things like dollar per hour ratio if you care about that like I do, I have found some side quests hidden around the game world; if you think you are running out of stuff to do, some exploring and finding those quests can help that! However, I feel like this game kind of goes a Gta 5 route where there isn't much to explore, a lot of buildings it seems like aren't enterable.

My original idea for a review was to compare this game to two massively disappointing games for me that I was hyped for in the past which were Gta 5 and Fallout 4, both greatly left me disappointed. It sucks that this game doesn't have a whole lot to explore it seems like, like Gta 5, but Gta 5 was way too big and too empty unlike this game. The good thing about this game is fast traveling and the map isn't overly big like Gta 5's, and like I said before I did manage to find some cool hidden side stuff while exploring a little bit. Oh, and this game is way more of an rpg than Fallout 4, one thing that I hated about that game was it wasn't an rpg game. Unfortunately, this game too has a voiced main player character, except the story and most of the dialogue turned out great on this one! As for Gta, Gta 5's story failed to interest me and keep me playing.

Does this game leave me disappointed like the other big names I mentioned? After going through the story I just went through, it is well worth the price. Also, the side quests I think are the best I've seen in any game I've played so far! The combat is surprisingly good and the driving isn't too bad on certain vehicles, happily surprised all those came out as good as they did considering the devs haven't made a game quite like this. However, bad performance when I meet the 1440p requirements even, and tons of bugs and a game world that doesn't seem as explorable as Fallout 4's does disappoint... I think the story, side quests and everything else can make up for it! Another thing, they got plenty of updates to do on this game too, so who knows what they'll add! The other Witcher games supposedly got stuff after the games were released, not just dlc.

Well, that was a long review so to summarize...

Best story I've played I think, but too short.
Best side quests I've seen, not all, but a good chunk of them!
Surprisingly good shooting action, decent driving handling.
Great city map with a decent wasteland outside of it, fast traveling too. Except not many enterable buildings, so not lots to explore.

Bad performance even on 1080 ti. So, you'll have to lower lots of settings and resolution.
Still lots of bugs, none game breaking for me but I have had to reload game saves. Good thing the game autosaves plenty.
Not as atmospheric as I'd have liked.
It just seems like after all these years there should be lots to do, but maybe exploring will fix it?",True

And I have to tell you this: Night City, the vibrant place that these people at CD have created, is [u]a beautiful living piece of art[/u]. I've never experienced anything like this, this fantastic handcrafted view into another world. The hard work and love that went into this game just resonates with me when I drive through this city...
Thank you CD Project for creating this wonderful experience.",True
"It's a great game apart from the technical issues such as poor performance, bugs, glitches etc. Most of them are going to be ironed out in future patches hopefully. In my 4 hours of playtime i've encountered several bugs and graphical glitches but none of them were game breaking altough some people claim that they've had to reboot the game many times. ıt should've been almost bug free after 7 years of development. Apart from all that jazz, the athmosphere is great. The voice acting is decent. As of now, i give this game a solid 7/10. This, of course, is a subject to change as the time goes on and developers roll out patches to fix the game. If they manage to turn it into a proper game then my score would only increase.

Edit1: After the 1.04 patch that CDPR just released, the experience of playing the game improved massively. There are stil some minor things to fix such as weird blurriness of the textures, texture loading times (yes, it's on an SSD) and item stat page getting stuck on the right hand side of the screen. Keep in mind that this is strictly my own experience though. At this state the game is totally playable. It's much nicer and runs like a proper game now. I also revise my score and give Cyberpunk 2077 9/10.",True
"The game is not what we expected. That's true. Marketing department lied and exaggerated everything.
But that's still a good game. More linear, a bit poor balanced at some spots but still VERY interesting to play and dive in. Atmosphere and stories told through the quests together with music shrugs off every problem.
I'd say that game had suffered a lot because they had to try to launch it on PS4 - render distance of actual objects is small and AI is very clunky but still as I said, I still enjoyed it.
I won't blame devs for this game. PR department and high-ranking managers desevre to be hang*d ofc for the mess they've created, but actual devs have put their soul into project and I can see that. Lack of management and excessive PR did bad to the game, but that's still GOOD.
Check it, buy it. I guarantee, that's a lot more worth it than any money-sucking mess from EA and similar corps - polished and souless. I'd better have games the way CDPR make them even if they're not perfect.",True
"Can't recommend in the current state. The Story and the main Characters in this game seems to be very intriguing so far but the gameplay seems to fall a bit short, the AI is just straight up dumb making it really easy to predict, we got Bethesda-tier types of bugs ranging from minor/fun ones to major/impactful ones in a large scale.

However, until some accessibility fixes/features are implemented I will not be playing this for a while. Once I got my character made and actually got into the game, I was presented with janky controls and a grainy hell of a world. There's some kind of particle looking effect on everything, and no matter what I did to lower/raise/adjust my graphics, nothing made it go away. I figured maybe I could deal with it, but it just made me extremely ill. After just 30 minutes of actual gameplay, I had to stop playing to spend the rest of the day expelling what seemed to be everything I'd eaten in the past year.

"A complete and utter technological clusterfuck, yet most people prefer to turn a blind eye to hundreds upon hundreds of issues just because CDPR is the developer. Whatever they released can't even be called a finished game, it's an early access beta with so many blatant and egregious bugs that I doubt the game went through any kind of QA before being kicked out of the door. This game is not just broken, it's ME:Andromeda broken.

But below all these glitches, broken animations and quest blockers is buried the biggest problem of all: a game that is just not all that good.
Despite all promises, it's not an RPG, it's an open world looter shooter with linear dialogues where your choice boils down to asking additional snippets of info on the current topic and pressing F (you can't rebind that key btw) to pay respects and move to next line of dialogue. Even if there's tension, game will not move forward unless you press the correct button. But game's biggest failure in being a role-playing game is the main character. A not-so-blank slate called V, character with no canon appearance or genitals, yet with personality and manner of speech that you can't stray away from. V is not you, they're Geralt of Rivia without any charm or backstory. And Geralt could at very least always be friendly, neutral or selfish, giving the player some basic ways to express themselves.
The problem is, even if it fails as an RPG, the game can always be very entertaining if they do open world and gameplay right, people like Skyrim and FO4 is fun, but Cyberpunk fails in this as well. Cars are weightless, aiming sensitivity feels wrong even with all aim assists off, police spawning out of thin air, and NPC AI is so dumb that even earlier 3D GTA games look more impressive in comparison, not to mention GTAIV or RDR2. Even hundreds of crowd extras in Hitman games know when to run away, and Cyberpunk peds can't figure out even that.
Fallout 4 is a painfully unfinished and rushed out game, yet even Fallout 4 understands what it is, and manages to be a better looter shooter, and even a better RPG, than CP2077.

I absolutely refuse to believe that this game has been in development for more than couple years, everything here is too raw and at odds with its own design.

"When I play this game, I see a game that will be great in about two years.

The performance is horrible. I'm using older (but still good) equipment (980 Ti, i7-6700K, 32 GB RAM); I cannot run this game in 1440p and clear 40 FPS on Low. I have to switch to 1080p to get ~55 average. It's not worth playing on these settings; the entire city looks lifeless, lightless, and like everyone is made of clay. There's too much visual noise.

I'm encountering a lot of audio issues - not the crackling some people are reporting, but odd spacial audio problems and extremely loud NPCs with feedback. The only characters that sound normal are ""V"", and anyone who calls on the phone.

The gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. Nothing we were promised is here. It was all stripped out. Animations largely look like they were intended for use in 3rd person, and at some point got changed to 1st person. Enemies are bullet sponges. AI is awful.

The stealth gameplay is truly bad, taking the worst aspects of every stealth game of the last decade or so. It's formulaic, and if your sneaking is broken, you have no ability to hide from the enemies again; that's it. You've gone loud.

I sincerely do not recommend this game in its current state, and that breaks my heart.

The one good side; the worldbuilding, the setting, the creativity, the quest design, the dialogue, the characterization... all of it is incredible. And that's the stuff that can't be easily fixed.

"If you have a competent PC, then read on. If you're running trash hardware, then wait until Feb. 

TL;DR 9/10 The game is a masterpiece of storytelling, the human condition, mortality, and how your life is connected to everyone else.
Graphics: 7/10 - there are areas and NPCs in this game which make me just drop my jaw and stare in awe. There are other areas and NPCs that make me think this game belongs in the PS3 Era. I played the game throughout on Digital Foundry's recommended settings for 1440p (High/Ultra, no ray tracing)
Gameplay: 7/10. 
Gameplay is arguably my biggest gripe. Gunplay is fantastic. Every single gun feels unique, punchy, vibrant, and good to use. Just wish there was a bit more variety in the guns. Net running could use a bit more depth, but arguably a very satisfying method of playing the game. Melee is arguably the weakest part of the game. Monowire is the strongest, but the least satisfying. Gorilla Arms and Mantis blades are weaker, but have better feel. Overall, the gameplay mechanics just don't give a sense of depth, not even to the Witcher 3 levels
Story - 10/10
Well, this is where Cyberpunk shines. The last two hours of the game had me so utterly bewildered at the choices in front of me. Cyberpunk forces very difficult choices on you. There are a multitude of endings that I have to unlock, but the one I did unlock just made me realize how utterly broken I felt at the options I had in front of me. The game plays with the concept of mortality, immortality, and what it means to be human in a way I didn't expect from such a flashy genre. 
If you're interested in picking this up, I would highly encourage it on a competent PC, after the fixes land. My time was fairly pleasant. I encountered a number of visual bugs, but almost no game breaking or mechanical bugs.",True

Internet is a great tool to easily manipulate legions of empty heads and it's F weird to see people almost turning a game into a kind of religion and more stupid to quit from your job to play a game.

This is absolutely the most overhyped and overrated game in recent memory. If it wasn't there wouldn't be so much defensiveness around it from the community and CDPR themselves. If a thing is done right it speaks for itself. When it isn't, people speak for it. I mean, if they were confident in their finished product (which customers are paying full price for) then a few days ago why would they need to force review sites not to show any gameplay other than that provided by CDPR? The game is pretty good but absolutely nothing spectacular. There has been so much hyped marketing for the game, maybe that budget would have been better spent on quality control. What a sham, even after 8 years of development and all the delays the game is still a buggy mess. 

Cyberpunk 2077 is sequel to ""masterpieces"" like Fallout 76 and Anthem, simply amazing indeed. 👎

"Eh, its alright i guess. not AAA nor worth 80 brass razoos but its decent. drop the price, make it feel ""Open World"" and get off your high horse... seriously. just because y'all got a guys who spent more than 3 minutes in your character creator looking at their players bussy saying ""WOW ITSHC SHO DETAILED"" dont make it AAA. its a over engineered tech demo of a game that you guys came up with one late night after eating those brownies some guy called frank brang in while watching blade runner. You are living off withcer 2 and 3's fame and the hype of people who act like they have been waiting their whole life for this but in reality they saw it pop up on their instagram one day and instantly became a philosopher on it after reading a post made by wired. but atleast you made a game with a major actor that was not as bad as vin diesels wheelman. but then again id have more plying wheelman by laughing at how bad it is. and with the money you made off this and knowing you would make money off from this due to the hype you'd think you would do a better job, you are as lazy as me when it comes to shaving the fluff off my nuts but atleast i can proudly sprout my ginger carrot patch without late night thoughts on scamming a bunch of teens who found out it had nudity or 20+ guys who hang out in caffes with black logos while sipping down of low skim gluten free dairy free milk powder latte and sporting beards longer than a africans legal cybernetic weapon concealed carried in their pants.

"·When I was in the eighth grade, I saw its first trailer, and I've been obsessed ever since. From then on, I began to fantasize about Night City with my friends. Imagine tall buildings rising and falling, a silvery night, neon lights, breezes, moonlight, and “peace”. 
·When I lived for a time in Lisbon, I had a friend, he was in despair and I was in despair. But our friendship was based on the idea in each of us that we would be sorry later if we did not explore this great city because of a game. We met every Sunday for five weeks and found something more wonderful than the imaginary Night City. We walked until our despairs disappeared and then we parted. To leave a game. We gave Lisbon to each other.
·For almost two years I have had remarkable friend whose imagination illuminates mine. We write long letters in which we often discover our strangest selves. Each of us appears, sometimes in a funny way, in the other’s dreams. She and I agree that, at certain times, we seem to be parts of the same mind.

"[b] TLDR at the very end [/b]

Great game, but doesn't excuse the terrible launch and lack of polish. Played 80 hours in a week, did everything i could for a first playthrough. 
Most side quests are tedium, go here, help the NCPD, with gigs being slightly more interactive and requiring more thought with optional objectives. Main story, especially the ending was quite underwhelming from me, i had more engagement and enjoyment with some of the more major, story-driven side quests. (Panam, Panam..) 

Stealth is very inconsistent, shooting feels nice, melee not so much, especially fist fighting. Double tap to dodge is a dumb feature, let us rebind it. Power Snipers are overpowered, they can penetrate through infinite layers of cover, i've killed entire enemy compounds without stepping a foot inside. 

UI and Menu can be very frustrating and clunky. Let me craft multiples of ammo, let me scrap multiple things at once.

Levelling is fun, but i feel like the level cap is too low. Crafting being tied to the tech skill, and not having ways to sell crafting specs mean i'm lugging around tons of useless legendary specs unless i'm running a tech heavy character.  Crits are overpowered, but i also love it to death, so i'm mixed about that.

Driving either feels like crap, or smooth, depending on the car. First person sucks in cars, use them in motorcycles. 

tl;dr: Do i love the game? Yes. Do i hate the game? Also yes. If you can dig past the optimization, and the myriad of gameplay and technical issues, you can like it.

"[h1] Imperfect Perfection [h1]

Cyberpunk is truly an interesting game. Obviously it's not the reincarnation of jesus and instant world peace some people wanted it to be, but to be honest it would have never been that type of game anyway.
It is a great game, don't get me wrong, and I [b] really [b] love it but yeah, it got a lot of flaws at the moment like bugs and bad performance. (Even though neither of those have really impacted me in any negative way)

The gameplay overall feels very smooth to me (doing a melee/sniper build so I can't say much about the feeling of other guns/weapons) and it's honestly addicting to just slice and dice people with my mantis blades. The driving could be better but you get used to it very quickly. The world is INCREDIBLE and the side missions are phenomenal, they definitely make up for the rather short main story on its own.

Overall I think the game is really awesome and a lot of fun, can't wait for the january patch to see if most of the problems are getting fixed or not",True

"I can not recommend this game at the moment. It does not have quite a few promised features like corrupt cops. It is also poorly optimized. Overpromised and underdelivered. I can run it fine with my ""last gen"" 2080 Super but you gotta remember when it was supposed to come out one year ago there were no RTX 3000 cards or next gen consoles so it should have run well on top last gen graphics cards... Don't even get me started on the PS4 and XBox One versions they are straight up terrible. Raytracing is also very expensive and can reduce your frame rates by quite a bit.

You will also experience a lot of bugs that are not neccessarily game breaking but highly immersion breaking. Ive met my fare share of T poses and you will find quite a few NPCs standing next to each other looking like exact clones. Ive also had a lot of NPCs having animation issues with guns not working properly and going invisible or not synchronising properly.",False
"Sadly this game disappoints even though i did not hop on the hype train. All Bugs aside. I still do not recommend this game to a lot of people.
Although i do have to warn people that this review might be irrelevant to most people as i did not enjoy the witcher game series as well.

This is obviously very unfinished regardless platform you are on. unfinished quests/content.
The first act in the whole game is probably the best thing about this game which made me keep the game and not refund it.
It had so much going on with action and emotion.
The game calls itself an RPG but maybe on today's standard it is as an game that has numbers on weapons are considered ""RPG's"".
But i feel a lot of options are forced and even if choose a different option the conversation tends to come back to the same context regardless the the option chosen.
And playing in steal with not killing a soul (which lets be honest is a very basic and bad steal and the hacking is just straight up bad which most people will use maybe 3 times throughout you're play through) or in full on Rambo mode and slaughter everything that moves does not effect or change anything whatsoever.
The driving seems to get the job done although not the best.
Most people loved the world that was created but to me it just felt Dead with the insanely Stupid A.I and the trash cop A.I.

Id say the game is fun but has its fair share of issues. its the most average game that has been released in a while in which they do alot of things within the game but its just done decent or just bad.
Not to mention Johnny silver hands acting just falls flat with no emotion.

Id say it is worth the play but only at a steep discount at 60 to 70% off and with everything fixed.",False

"A wonderfully unfinished game, Cyberpunk 2077 has been one of the most anticipated games released in the last five years and rightfully so, yet this release was not without fault.

Graphically stunning, there are so many ways to experience this title and not one person can deny that, aesthetically, this title takes you right in!

For any high-end audiophiles you will find that the sound engine was missed, it is common issue enough to find users who have already troubleshot the crackling audio issues affecting users using sampling rates above 96K within 4 hours of the title releasing. Moving past the audio issues, overall the depth is great yet the soundtrack falls flat and there are many 'dead spots' throughout the game such as you find no soundtrack and mild ambiance. This personally had left me underwhelmed.

The storyline is a bit chaotic during the beginning phases but can be caught on shortly thereafter, it's intuitive and interesting to say the least.

Game engine is a near complete bust, many collision glitches causing random items when entering areas to 'explode' or be launched in the air. It would be unwise not to save often but not for the fear of dead by a hostile NPC but, instead the many character trapping glitches with the environment. It is common place more often than not to encounter glitches involving NPCs or yourself, most do demand a chuckle but this is something simply inexcusable and what really makes me not want to recommend this title in it's current state.

Overall I still enjoy playing this title but cannot recommend it in it's current glitch ridden state, if you do not mind loading often or getting stuck or killed by glitches, this title is for you. If not, I'd say delay your purchase till this receives a heavy patch job.",False
"Don't listen to everyone complaining about this game. The majority of people complaining are moaning about In game bugs (which don't even affect the game all that much), the stability of the game and the poor console port. 

Firstly the majority of bugs are not game breaking. There is easy ways around them which often just involve a quick reload or simply ignoring them. There will most likely be some cases where bugs ruin the feel of the game but unfortunately you're just going to have to deal with these. 

As for the stability of the game and the poor console ports. The game is a next gen title, So i don't get why people are so sour about the game not working on Last Gen Consoles. On top of that. I don't get why people are moaning that the game doesnt run well on 5 year old Hardware. The game was modeled to be played on higher end machines. Its 2020 not 2016 anymore people..........Alot happens in that time span. The specs they put out are true. You can play the game on those settings with some fine tuning for your own experience, You can't expect a game to run exactly how they say it will, everyones PC is different. My pc meets the requirements for High Settings. With some tuning and some testings I am running the game at 1080p on majority high settings (A few things turned down that are not important) and Im ranging from 50-60fps constantly. Although if I just set it to Default high then I can barely hit 45 average. 

The game is new, The game is a singleplayer story driven game which cannot afford to let 50 thousand people do test runs like other multiplayer games can do. Its their first undertaking within this theme of game play. Witcher 3 was just as buggy on launch but was fixed through updates and listening to the community. Stop expecting it to be perfect just because it was delayed, enjoy the game for what it is. The story writing was amazing, The Graphics and landscapes are breathtaking. With time it will be polished.

"I hate nipples, they are the bane of my existence. I cannot eat my favorite food, pepperoni pizza, without being overwhelmed with imagery of nipples.

"Funny enough, even the review portion of the game page on Steam is bugged right now, which pretty well sums up how this game went. Everyone has heard all the controversy about bugs and performance issues and everything along those lines, but what shocks me is how little the complete mediocrity of the game itself seems to be overlooked by people saying ""Well the story is good...""

I think William Gibson summed it up best in his tweet 2 years before the game was even released ""The trailer for Cyberpunk 2077 strikes me as GTA skinned-over with a generic 80s retro-future, but hey, that's just me."" That's really all this game is. A city with people wearing Neon and the same 15 advertisements plastered everywhere in hologram (oooooh the future is here). 

This game has about as much in common with cyberpunk as Star Trek. A more apt description might be Outrun 2077, because Cyberpunk 2077 is really only cyberpunk on the surface with Neon ads, ""hacking"" and bio-modified people. And none of those things are inherently cyberpunk (or even done remotely well), they are retro-future or even just common threads in scifi. It seems like the people praising this game are fanboys, yes, but are also clearly only aware of Cyberpunk as combing 80s (or 90s) style with a futuristic setting. They don't seem to be capable of actually looking beyond the bare surface of a video game as a compiled set of features, and asking how well or poorly each box is checked.

Cyberpunk (the genere) is gritty, it is dark and grungy. Both Blade Runners (and the animated shorts), Neuromancer and its sequels and Ghost in the Shell 1996 are all hallmark cyberpunk works, and they share a set of distinct aesthetic and thematic threads which Cyberpunk 2077 has not only failed to address, it has missed entirely. Cyberpunk 2077 doesn't even seem to know what cyberpunk is.

This game is glossy GTA, if GTA didn't really work. What ""hacking"" there is is a complete joke, and nothing about the city manages to live up to the key theme of the Cyberpunk genere, which is the collision of society with the moral implications of future technology. That is what this game promised to offer, more deeply than exploring a city, or driving or shooting or roleplaying, or upgrading your character which lord knows have been beaten to death in every AAA title for the past 10 years. If I wanted to steal cars, commit crimes and do jobs, I can go play one of a dozen driving themed games which stay in their lane. Cyberpunk is a watered down version of GTA in that it seems to most closely have taken inspiration from GTA V (probably because of the games commercial success) and does everything down to the detail less well than a game which predates it by more than 7 years. There are no moral decisions. There are no decisions at all, but even the element of conflicting with future technology is only briefly implied with the dilemma of Johnny (Keanu Reaves), and even then, it's less of a discussion of the actual implications of the technology, and more of an action movie about someone trying to save themselves.

People praising this game may have found something endearing. And sure, the story isn't bad. It's half dialogue, which basically defeats the point of a video *game*, but whatever, it's decently written and well acted. The mechanics aren't terrible. The gunplay is fine, the driving is mediocre but passable. But these people defending the game even now seem to be holding on to some strange delusion not only about the product that was initially promised, but about the constant flaunting of missed potential everywhere in this game.

See, not only does Cyberpunk not live up to what is (present tense) advertised, the last minute culling of scope is present everywhere in the city as half finished mechanics like brain dance vendors and oh I don't know Police chases (which it's not like this was a hard one to decide to include in a game that managed to basically boil itself down to a half assed driving game). Not only is it clear that the scope of the game was decreased massively as crunching ensued from poor management in early development, but CDPR didn't even have the wherewithal to actually remove the fragments of scrapped mechanics (I'm looking at you locked doors and public transit entrances).

The lack of anything that really resembles the aesthetic and sort of ethereal nature of cyberpunk in Cyberpunk(2077) isn't only depressing because it's not there, but because I have a hard time believing that the *thing* that's missing from this game (along with an actually branching story and several other poorly spaghetti-ed together systems like character progression and gear acquisition, gang alliances and rivalries, vehicle customistation, relationships, housing, large chunks of the map, functioning AI and pathing, reasonable physics, texture and model popping, terrible hacking to name *just a few*) is that they aren't likely to come with future patches. I have a hard time believing the base form of the game will get much more polish and tune up than bug fixes. Whether or not you agree that this game is missing the mojo it was supposed to have, there's no denying that the amount of things that need to be fixed in order to get this game in even the same ballpark as what was initially promised looks like another 10 year development cycle in and of itself. At this point why would they even bother patching it to that extent? They already sold millions of copies, there's no financial incentive to improve on the base game in any more ways than necessary. I hope I eat my words on that, but I'm not counting on it. And at this point it's almost worse if features that were promised end up showing up in future paid DLC. Sure they'd be there, but in a game that supposedly set in the Corpotocratic cyberpunk future, talk about irony.

You can tell me this game is good. And sure, maybe some of it's features are good (I would argue you can get basically everything that this game does ""well"" much better elsewhere). But a game is more than the sum of its parts (which even as a sum, this full-priced massively anticipated mess of popsicle sticks and glue is hardly anything to gawk at). But none of these things have anything in common with the clearly laid out vision of a *Cyberpunk* world. And what gets me so much is that no one seems to be acknowledging that. 90% of reviews are just a discussion of features and how well x or y is done, with everyone looking no further than their own nose to form a conclusion about the product. This sort of add mechanic-check the box-brag about it is how we end up with AAA failures time and time again. This attitude towards video games as a set of functions not only creates scope creep (of which this game is a prime example), it lets developers off the hook for creating genuinely good games. Games which have a soul. The story's alright, you can drive cars, the voice acting is quite good, but the game has no soul. Not a cohesive one anyway. And for a game whose setting is defined by the implications of progress without bounds and the cancer of corporate greed, it would almost be funny if it wasn't just so sad to see how off the mark this game really is.",False

"This game was an experience, and I loved every second of it. The story is excellent, filled with characters who are really well done and believable, and who are developed way beyond being merely two-dimensional. The first person - which I wasn't too keen on at first - makes this game really special: you get to sit next to these characters, have a conversation with them and it's immersive on a level I haven't seen in other RPGs before. It feels as if you're there, and it makes more emotional moments even weightier, exemplified because you feel as if you're interacting with real people, with real motivations and feelings.

The gameplay has been a point of contention, but I feel it's really fun and allows for a lot of builds. It's a bit of a drag starting off, but as you push that level up your character becomes a force of nature - whether that be an insanely fast ninja using either katanas or mantis blades, a stealthy netrunner clearing out entire hideouts with but a few hacks, or an unstoppable juggernaut utilising shotguns and heavy weaponry, it's all up to you. There's a lot of ways to approach things no matter how you play, and the stellar level design allows for a number of approaches - there's a lot of verticality, and routes into buildings aren't restricted to, say, an open door at the front. Some can be found off the beaten path, and getting the double jump upgrade expands on this, as you'll find yourself parkouring across rooftops like a madman and getting the drop on your foes from an unseen vantage. I had a blast with it, and I found myself getting into scraps regularly with small groups of gangers just because it feels so good. Weapons have a lot of impact, are animated really well, and are all satisfying to use. It's for sure a step above the Witcher 3's gameplay, which was more divisive.

There are a few issues I had with the gameplay however. You get showered in loot all the time so you're often dismantling it all or trying to sell it, and this makes getting a new weapon less exciting, as all you care about is equipping something for the stat boost. The crafting doesn't do much to remedy this, as you have to level it a ton and it'll be a while before you can craft good weapons - which will be quickly outclassed by what you find as loot. The loot issue also extends to the clothing. Sure, you can equip blue or purple clothing items that have mod-slots, and put armour mods in it so you can use it until end-game, but you're still missing out on a lot of clothing and you can't really equip what you want unless you want to take a massive stat penalty. The game is practically crying out for a transmog system as a result. The AI can also be very dumb at times, especially the police - you get a wanted level and they appear from thin air, and they can't drive. Another thing that irks me is the fact that cyberware can be a bit one-dimensional. The monowire no longer has the hack ability as shown in the trailers, and is just a melee weapon with a charge. The stealth animations aren't even changed if you have it or other weapons equipped, which is a disappointment. The gorilla arms also work differently to how you'd think they would: having them doesn't increase your strength, and you have to increase the related stat before you're able to open certain doors or rip off turrets, and the only thing that changes is you get a different animation with them. I'd much prefer it if you got a stat boost dependent on what you have equipped (eg: monowire buffs your hacking, and gorilla arms buff your strength).

As for the driving, it feels a bit off at times. Some vehicles feel super floaty and handle like there's a delay built into the engine before you can stop or turn a corner, meaning you often have to do so in advance. Whereas other vehicles handle excellently - especially the bikes and the Mitzuani Shion. I feel the problems with what is a crucial part of the game could be remedied with just a little bit of tuning, and by panning the minimap out further while driving (so you can actually see turns coming). An auto-drive feature would also be nice - it is 2077 after all.

Concerning performance, I had no issues. I was running the game at ultra (with shadows brought down a setting) without any noticeable stutter or frame drops on an RTX 2070 + i5-8600. The game looks beautiful, and there's a lot of care put into every inch, everywhere you look. The character models are the primary example of this: you'll catch little details you wouldn't normally notice taking portrait shots in the photo mode, from the facial features to the clothing. On the whole the game seems well optimised too, but then again, I don't have a low-end rig around or above the minimum recommended settings to confirm this. If you have a lower-end rig, I'd recommend holding off on a purchase until you upgrade, as you'll just be limiting yourself on the detail front.

There are also quite a lot of bugs and glitches that have caused me to reload my save. These aren't necessarily a detriment to the experience as a whole, but it disrupts the flow. As a result I've put the game on hiatus for the time being until they patch them all out, and if you're on the fence about this game I'd recommend you do the same unless you can live with the issues. Hopefully this comes sooner rather than later, because I can't wait to jump back into Night City once everything has been addressed.",True

The soundtrack is damn good, just like TW3's was, with also a great selection of radio songs. Combat is very good with a lot of variety in your weapon choices and cyberware that can change the way you play, it's a bit like an immersive sim in an open world, think Deus Ex or the modern Prey reboot.

This game isn't smoothest plushie in toy store but you can still hug it and it will warm You, and like abusive alcoholic partner it will caress You with immersion and bond to story then right away hit You some major glitch.

Ran this game on machine that needs surely upgrade,  680/i5 but over all on mid to high settings,  stroking down some cascading and game ran smoothly for me besides few sutters. But. God. This game is beautiful. I even ramped everything on top, turned my PC to temporary oven just to make some good shots and immerse.

Didn't ecounter many visual glitches, besides some T-posing and V suddenly deciding it's more punk to go bald. But I guess it was just my luck? Not ""rUnS oN mY rig"" type.

Bugs..- there are major bugs in this game even after patches, getting stuck in two convos, getting suck in thin air, softlocking game just by entering map those things that sorta break immersion and make you say ""haha here we to again (^: "" , those are some mild defects that I can cope with.


Storywise, Gameplay, Mechanics 

Story actually makes You care about cast despite it's length, You actually feel your answers could have impact on their personality, story is deeper , it's also small redemption ark for character You barely know and you are getting to it. CDPR shines especially in side quests, speaking of them, they are great,  even if they are some minor fetch quests they make it work with all the roam around the NC, every corner has some goodies, some baddies and something to poke to for adventure. You can always rush game withing several hours span but where is fun in that.

Gameplay is broken, let's get real, AI plays DnD and throws dice either executing some good combination of moves to actually suprise You or it's critical failure and stands still waiting for *their* execution. Gunplay/Melee feels oddly satisfying like mowing grass in warm summer afternoon. I played game on Hard and didn't notice much difference,  since with proper perks You just hit like truck, there is no difficulty curve besides ""be faster or eat dirt"" that's why most of ecounters are solvable just by slapping silencer on your iron. 

Speaking of perks, mechanically this game can't really seems to decide what it is, elements of atributte checks like any RPG,same thing for perks,DPS as some looter shooter with tiers of gear, numbers flying even if enemies are usually dying on 2-3 hits..but so do You.

[b]Regarding the Complains about Bugs:[/b]

Listen here to all the People Complaining about Bugs and Glitches, do i need to remind anyone of the mess Skyrim was and still is!
Or any Fallout Game, The Witcher series is also on the list for Buggy quests and Glitches, and yet this game gets all the Hate!
Like come on Guys cut CDPR some slack for making the FIRST game of its kind, i know the bugs can be annoying especially when the missions Glitch out and cant be Finished, to counter that just make many Quicksaves using F5!


[b]Regarding Blurry Graphics:[/b]

I encountered this myself, the game seems to look blurry even on ultra settings, turning off the Film Grain and Chromatic aberration seemed to make it alot better but it still looked blurry.
What i did to make the game look sharper is, i downloaded a reshade and only enabled ContrastAdaptiveSharpen and it fixed it for me!


[b]Regarding Performance:[/b]

CDPR made it clear that this game would be demanding when they released the RTX2080ti in the Cyberpunk theme, and yet they tried to optimize it alot and succeeded with that in my eyes!

The story of this Game is a Masterpiece, its told in a unique way wich i haven't seen before, there are no Cutscenes there is no taking the player out of the Game to show you something, you experience it all in First Person wich is just amazing!
The Characters feel unique and have a actual Personality, they treat you differently depending on the Choices you make in the dialogue!
Especially the Decision making is what got me hooked, there are so many choices you can make that influence the Gameplay and story, it sometimes took me more than 10 minutes to decide on what i should do or say!
There are also quite a few endings in this Game, depending on who you killed or who you sided with, it all comes back to you in the end and i loved every bit of it!
NPCs look Diverse and have interesting Body augmentations.
Most side quests feel better than most Story quests in other Games!
The world around is full with the shine of Neon signs and Ads for new Body parts or the newest invention of pleasures.
The Streets are full with people who interact with each other or just going about their day!

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
The game is a Bug infested Masterpiece wich hooks you with its World and Characters if you give it the chance to do so!

All in all a solid [b]9/10[/b] for me (and easily better than everything 2020 gave us so far!)

i'd still advise to wait for a sale since 60 Bucks is a hefty Price!

Thank you CDPR this game is amazing!",True
"[h1] A fixable game [/h1]

[b] Pros: [/b] Good main story, lots of good gigs and side jobs. 

Most of the gigs and side jobs are very well done, but there are some that have been annoying. Can't mention them due to potential spoilers. 

Loved gameplay it's feels like Borderlands 2 and I really like the gameplay because of that.  

The main story mission is very well animated and clearly explained. 

[b] Cars: [/b] Handling wise it's very bad, if you hit a curb at highspeed you're gonna spin out and crash. The steering is slow and wonky, it feels like Watch Dogs handling which was very damn bad. In corners you can easily spin out and the braking on some vehicles are just bad. 

Aesthetically the sport cars are very futuristic of course and aesthetically pleasing. My currently favorite vehicle is the Quadra Type-66 ""Avenger"". 

[b] Cons: [/b] FPS wise it's not great, been using a GTX 980 TI and I'm currently only getting 67 FPS on the lowest graphic settings available. Also using Dynamic FidelityFX CAS with 165 FPS as the target. Minimum resolution is 65 and max is 100. 

Tried using my other GTX 980 TI, but the SLI performance is very bad as I only achieved 30-40 FPS.

[b] Graphics: [/b] I haven't been able to see the at full RTX Ultra settings yet so this will not effect the review only the FPS performance will effect the review

[b] Bugs: [/b] Random T-posing characters, vehicles having weird collision and sometimes just being stuck in each other, purchasable vehicles being in the ground, characters just bugging out in general. 

[b] Animation and voice acting: [/b] The facial animation is not as bad as Watch Dogs Legion and the acting is definitely better than that. Atleast it's not Mass Effect Andromeda level of acting. 

Kenau Revees aka Johnny Silverhand did a good job switching between being a rude MF and being a understandable character because of his past. 

[b] Final Score: [/b] 7/10 as of now

"I am writing this as someone who never watched anything about the game before release to not get spoiled. So I don't know what exactly was promised compared to the final product.

What I can tell you though, is that this is a fantastic game. I find the story to be amazing and captivating and find myself strolling around the world to find new sidequests to do before progressing the story. I don't really care about the open world stuff, its more of a bonus to me. I focus on the RPG aspects and those are just brilliant. So if your'e anything like me you will love this game.

In regards to bugs:
Personally, I can recount the times I've experienced bugs on one hand and even if I had any they were never gamebraking or annoying, just funny. But I know I might be in the minority here. If you're really worried about that and don't want to risk having your experience ruined by them then it's probably not a bad call to wait some time for new patches to come out. Again, from my experience though, I never encountered problems with that.",True
Ignore the bad reviews. Im playing on 1650 and 8gb ram and its fucking great,True
"The world is beautiful but just feels so hollow. 
Loot system is weird, got a mod for my pistol that reduces my ADS time by -0,06% like thefuck is the point of that.
Cyberware also feels pointless if my arm mounted rocket launcher deals half of the damage my main gun does.

Crafting is also pointless, for the entirety of the game i collected enough components to craft ONE weapon that is an upgrade for my signature gear pistol, that made it worse for some reason.

Story is pretty cool but it feels like your choices don't make any difference. Game skips a huge part of V's life in a montage that could have been a cool addition to the story.",False

"First, I'm playing on Linux via Proton, thus I have an objectively worse experience.
Second, my hardware is slightly outdated, but according to CDPR, pretty much exactly the recommended specs.
Third, I'll admit to being slightly overhyped, overshadowing this review slightly.

TL;DR: 
It's a 10/10 characters experiencing a 8/10 story in a 6/10 world in a 4/10 game.

>The Characters
Holy fuck, one might even call them somewhat human. The amount of soul in the Characters is immense. They act, look and feel very natural. The different ways you interact with them are also quite good, the problem is that they don't always sync up (calling someone while literally being in the same room as them and they end up idk, breaking down on the phone while being chill af in the gameworld).

>The Story
""Main Story short"", we've all heard it, but the narrative is just plain good. The dialogue is just as good, but misses the ""choose your own path"" feel CDPR told us it would have. The endings feels weirdly both rewarding and unsatisfying, but I feel like that's mostly because of how the game told us that we're dying, there is a terrorist in our head, then we can spend literal ingame years without anything, and then in the end it's the rush again, it just feels all very very disconnected. 
The Side stories, which also overlaps a lot with the next point, are a mixed bag of diamonds and active grenades. There's a lot more memorable and deep quests than in the Witcher 3, but also a lot more stinkers. The more story focused missions, especially the 4 romance option questlines are just absolute bangers. I also love quests that go into the absolute absurd and marcarb a lot, since you don't see that a lot in games, especially props to the makers of The Sinnerman and the Dream On quests.

>The World
A world that looks this alive and acts this dead is a miracle of technology, but not a good one. The world designers and graphics people went above and beyond here, and you can definitely feel that. Sadly, it's just not enjoyable to be in this world. I could drive hours upon hours in GTA V and Just Cause 4 and watch the world around me, but in Cyberpunk that is simply not a thing, since there is no world around the player, at least not an enjoyable and believable one.
There is just such a disconnect between the Characters and Stories, which are so polished and make Night City give the vibe it gives, and the actual NIght City. 

>The Game
The shooty part: A very unoriginal First Person Shooter with a somewhat good but totally unbalanced RPG system, but the 3 different weapon categories are very nice.
The talky part: The ""you're in a dialogue but can do whatever you want"" system looks mindblowingly amazing on paper, was executed ""okay"" and often just doesn't work, since you can't even do simple things like sitting somewhere or eating and drinking while talking unless the game actively wants you to. This takes away a lot from this ""do whatever you want"" part.
The immersion part: Non-existant. There is nothing even trying to make you immersed into the game. Shop GUIs that were used last millenium, you as the main character feel nothing like a human being, just a story telling element, and the disconnection between the Characters and Stories of NC, and the actual NC, as mentioned above, just takes the broken immersion to a next level and completely stomps on it.
The drivy part: Vehicles look fantastic, but feel uninspired and untested. GTA V's first person driving is better than Cyberpunk's, while GTA V is the third person focused game, and CP's the first person one. The only enjoyable part of driving is watching the gorgeous landscapes and city, but nothing about the driving itself brings me any joy.
The punchy part: Melee combat is either batshit unrewarding or batshit overpowered, but never really satisfying. Katanas/Mantis Blades at least have some satisfying combos and animations, but the blunt weapons in the game are just plain bad
The RPG part: Counting both Cyberware and Attributes/Perks here. The content is good, since it's a good mix of ""increase stats by %"" and ""open new ability"", which is what makes a RPG system good. The balancing however is just bad. After level 20 or more than 3 legendary Cyberwares installed, the game becomes a cakewalk on Hardest difficulty. The game was marketed as an RPG first, everything else second, yet the RPG system seems the most untested and broken part that isn't just bugs, but intentional game design.
The performance part: Expectably bad, considering it's a multi-platform game, and nearly all multi-platform games perform bad. I am actually positively surprised that it runs as good on Linux as it does, but that doesn't mean it doesn't need several performance patches. Big ones.
The buggy part: yeah.


For a rating, again, it's a 10/10 characters experiencing a 8/10 story in a 6/10 world in a 4/10 game.


In total, I'll give it a very unsolid 7/10.",True

this game is awesome would recommend condom before launching,True
"The game is terrible as it is. CDPR promised a lot and have not delivered at all. Apart from technical problems the game fails to be even mediocre at its core. Here's a brief sum of what i can recall:

[h1] Tech problems[/h1]

[b] Perfomance [/b] 
It struggles to run smooth even on most modern pcs (as of its release state). The problem is increased tenfold when you get into the city - and that doesn't happen until after you're 20-40 minutes into  the game, so you can have an illusion of smooth gameplay at first. That fails shortly as soon as you go into freeroam. My rig is RTX 3070 with 2600X and 16GB ram and i get 15-30 fps in the city on medium-high settings for my 1440p monitor. That is not an acceptable level of optimisation.

[b] Bugs and glitches [/b]
They are everythere. It is not like you can encounter 1-2 minor bugs and just ignore them - problems happen in almost every mission and range from small things like npcs spawning in front of you to game breaking stuff like not being able to progress at all because of constantly teleporting npc or you clipping and dying for no reason. The amount of times you just have to load previous game save is astounding.

[h1] Gameplay problems[/h1]

[b] This is not an RPG [/b]
CDPR has since stopped promoting this game as an RPG, naming it instead an action-adventure game, but we all remember it being called a ""next-level rpg, which would bring a witcher 3 to its knees"". The dialogue is lacking, your decisions barely matter and you just go forward on story rails. Your origin matters only in first 20-30 minutes of the game, after that it is the same thing for every path.

[b] Game mechanics are from 2014 [/b]
Gunplay is bad, shooting doesn't feel rewarding at all, enemies are bullet sponges, overall gunfights feel like content-fillers and you mostly wait for them to end. Stealth is completely useless and boring, hacking amounts to maybe 2 actions you could perform, which aren't really adding much to gameplay, just distract enemy or deal minor damage - throwing stone to distract enemy would have been exactly the same mechanic. Overall, the core gameplay is not good, not fun and is an obstacle to enjoying the game.

[b] Loot mechanics [/b]
There is a lot of loot and it is all the same, you just don't care about all the same guns you get, as the only attribute that matters is DPS and it steadily progresses over the course of the game. Crafting is absolutely useless.

[b] Character customization [/b]
It is not thorough, you have very limited options, you cant even apply individual tattoos or tech augments to your skin and once you choose your appearance - that's it, you cant change it, you cant even get a new haircut ingame. Skillpoints don't really matter too, all the skill options are kind of bland and not gameplay changing, mostly you get plain percent bonus to some stat and honestly i might as well not have such a system in place at all.

[b] Dead world [/b]
The open-world aspect is terrible. NPCs are some of the simplest AI in modern games, you can't really interact with NPCs on street, can't buy food from street vendors, cant get involved in anything in the city, npcs spawn and despawn all around you and are essentially all the same. It is not immersive at all.

[b] Driving [/b]
Driving is as bad as it can be. Bad physics, bad navigator (it doesn't even show more of the map at high speeds so you are constantly missing turns) and no car customization at all.

[b] Not polished at all [/b]
You can't customize your apartment, you don't see cutscenes for new augments to your body, there is no complex lives of npcs in open-world, there is nothing you'd expect from a polished open-world RPG game.

There's a reason people who got early access were unable to release game play footage. its clunky for some movement, gun play is pretty good, melee is fucking awesome, and unarmed is so terrible I couldn't bear to use it unless it was stealth.

"No, just no. They blatantly LIED to us for years, this game is nothing like they advertised it would be. I don't want to support these kind of business practices in gaming, the industry is already spiraling out of control, this needs to stop!

If I were to score this game excluding the bugs, I would rate it a 5/10. The bugs are a major issue yes, but the game as a whole is just terrible.

Terrible Gun play.
Terrible AI.
Terrible Driving.
Terrible Main Story.

Buildings you can't enter, zones you can't enter, rooms you can't enter. You can't interact with the citizens in the city, you can't interact with the vendors around the city. You can't do this, you can't do that, you will be asking yourself why they even made this world so big and detailed to begin with, if the game won't even let you do anything in it.

 This isn't a RPG, at all. Your decisions do NOT matter, the game will always end in the same exact spot where you have 3 choices to how the game will end.

The only saving grace this game has, is some of the characters and Keanu Reeves. I used to think the story was okay, but after digesting it after awhile, I finally realized the story is really bad.  it just throws you right into it, without any sort of build up or character development, there is this really lame ""time skip"" that is a 30 second cut scene montage 30 minutes into the game, then it spits you into this huge ""heist"" that you have no idea why and you don't even know the characters you are working with. The ONLY character who develops throughout the story is Johnny (Keanu).

Another good thing to note about this game, is that the world looks nice and has an insane amount of detail. Seriously, the attention to detail is out of this world. Until you look at the food Vendors are selling, you will be laughing at what hot dogs looks like.

So no, this isn't a living breathing world, where you can do whatever you want and make impactful decisions. It is a story driven, action adventure, open world game, with light RPG elements.",False
"Probably the most amazing game experience ever!

This game sums up the best from may favourite stealth games like Thief and Deus ex etc and has an incredibly large and well designed open world that can allow 200-300+ play through's if you don't rush the story.

I love games with complex skill tree systems and mature looting/inventory mechanics. It seems that CR PR have really mastered and understand what makes a game truly good.

I've been a fan since The Witcher 1 and cannot believe they have consistently created gold. I play on a 1080 GTX with an I7 4790 but am able to play with setting to max. I have some small FPS issues that will get fixed soon no doubt.

I cannot wait to start over again with another path knowing much more about the game than i did on my first play through and look forward to future patches and DLCs.

Thank you CD PR for a truly immersive and wonderful game.",True

"[h1]Cyberpunk 2077 - Spoiler-free Review[/h1]
Cyberpunk is an open world, first-person RPG where you play as V, a mercenary trying to make a name for themselves in the metropolitan dystopia of Night City.
------------
I don't like scores, but it's a good way for people to get an idea of where a game stands in different categories, so I use them for those of you who don't like reading too much. According to my system, a 5 is completely in the middle, not like IGN and Gamespot, where a 5 is a disaster.
------------
[*][u]Visuals[/u] 9.5/10 [Graphics - 10 | Artstyle - 9]

Cyberpunk is graphically impressive and stands as the most visually striking and detailed urban open world game to date. Everything from lighting to character design, animation and scene composition is superb.
Some pop-in is noticeable due to the density of scenes but is not overly distracting.
In terms of style, there is a surprising amount of 90s influence and dominance of the Kitsch style, which can often feel at odds with the deeply personal and emotional storyline.


[*][u]Gameplay[/u] 8/10

There has been a lot of uninformed negativity regarding Cyberpunk's gameplay, and I want to address that in this section.
- RPG elements: Several different and distinct builds are possible and viable, making use of the various skill trees. Perks are a combination of more marginal upgrades to things like damage with a certain weapon type and more noticeable changes such as large multipliers to different statistics or entirely new functions such as aerial takedowns. Levels will often include pathways or obstacles with attribute checks, allowing for different builds to navigate the levels in different ways. Cyberware opens things up further by offering additional functions such as a double jump, bullet-time, ability to use homing ""Smart"" weapons and more. The only downside to the RPG elements of building and playing your character is that a few options which might seem interesting at face value (throwing knives) are redundant and poorly implemented.
- Level Design: In short, Deus Ex Lite. Levels will regularly feature multiple entrances and paths, allowing you to approach them in whatever way suits your build/cyberware or explorative nature.
- Enemy AI: Serviceable though not groundbreaking. They will still flank you while receiving covering fire from their allies, try to flush you out of cover with grenades as melee enemies rush you down while dodging your shots and so on, so they are reasonably engaging.
- Systems: Ranged and Melee combat have dedicated systems which are reasonably involved, while Hacking functions similarly to magic in fantasy RPGs with its own resource system and various satisfying effects you can apply to enemies. Stealth is rudimentary but deeper than most non-dedicated games featuring it, audio and sightlines both play a role, and your build can dramatically impact your success when sneaking. The RPG elements of Cyberpunk take precedence over your skill as a player in most cases, but the combat and general gameplay remains engaging if a bit clunky at times with its stiff interaction animations.
- Open World: Generally poor compared to something like GTA, it's not CDPR's strong suit and not a great first attempt either. Driving and pedestrian AI is rudimentary, and interaction with the world happens almost exclusively through quests. It's set dressing more than a world you immerse yourself in through play.

"Its unfortunute that none RTX users ( or next gen GTX series. ) will have really bad FPS issues. Well i really have good gaming PC with designed RTX so im not gonna talk bout the performance issues. I finished the main quest about 23 hours and i think the main story was pretty ''Good'' actually. Not a masterpiece but it was  a breathtaking for me. So 23 hour on main story didnt felt enough. I dont know if its good or bad thing. Could've been more like witcher 3.  With all side quest's you can go abooooout 70 hours maybe ? Side quests of Judy's and Panam's was really decent. You also can enjoy on side quests they are also( Decent/Good)
So my review on this game is out of 8/10",True
"Update: I have now played the game for a good bit over 100 hours on the same character, and honestly, a lot of my opinions havent changed, but what did change was for the better. I got to know some more characters with an astonishing questline and story. Played through the ending after hitting level 50 and finishing everything i felt was ""In character"". How everything is put together at the end, and how your relations with other characters play a role, even if its just a call, is really great. Many interesting sidequests to do, places to explore, and an insane amount of references to especially music, but also things such as movies. Nobody ever gets the same ending. 
Improvements such as getting rid of some rare stuttering, and fixing the 8mb save file limit has also arrived since the original review.
The combat in this game feels great, although quickhacks and such feel somewhat niche, but this is subjective. Gunplay overall feels good, no matter what you use, even if you arent specced into that weapon class. Melee too feels solid, especially in 1 on 1 combat. Can get a bit chaotic when fighting groups.

Original review below:

DISCLAIMER: at the time of writing this, i have not completed the game yet, but i have about 53 hours according to steam, have max street cred, and am level 32. To be updated when i finish the game

Cyberpunk 2077 all in all is an alright game, that has way more issues than i would like it to, both design-wise, and in terms of bugs. If you have played The Outer Worlds, you will notice several similarities between these two games, especially in how weapon upgrades, levels, perk progression, pickups and such work.

When you start a new save, you are met with a character creator for your character, V. CDPR has made it so you can customize both body type, genitalia, and voice, independent of eachother. HOWEVER, romance options, how you are referred to in game, such as ""she"" or ""miss"" is tied to your voice. You also have no option to change your appearance whatsoever, aside from clothing, after exiting the creator. You cannot even change makeup or hairstyle. The only visual change that will ever come to your character is if you decide to install arm or hand cybernetics. Despite you witnessing and talking to people about replacing various parts, changing their faceplates, seeing people with metal hands, this it not an option for you whatsoever. 

UI wise, the game in its current state (17th dec 2020), has a lot of bugs. It can display the wrong rarity for mods attached to clothing pieces, stats dont update when they should in the inventory, there are a few rare spelling errors. You can also find ""Shards"" (equivalent of finding a book/note/log/holotape) that completely lack text or name. In one instance i also experienced missing one snip of dialogue entirely during the beginning of a sidequest. Some animations can bug out, especially when you do things like ripping open doors, your arms can be invisible (but some of the time it works). All in all, i have not experienced anything gamebreaking, aside from a freeze on the map twice, that i could not find a solution to aside from alt+f4-ing and starting the game.

The game in itself is very pretty visually. Beautiful lightning, textures and just visual detail overall. It has rtx/dlss support too. Raytracing makes it look even better, but i personally decided not to play with it.
Performance is OK, have not encountered anything like stuttering, it just appears to be a bit of a heavy game.
The world is, interesting to explore, and with the right path and possibly skill/cyberware, you can really climb up anywhere, and jump from rooftop to rooftop. In terms of cyberpunk aesthetic however, the shape of the world is interesting, but feels very tame, and flat, compared to what it could have been, especially in the largest areas of the city. 

Writing of the game is to my untrained mind, pretty good. The characters i have met so far, really have had a heart and soul, and said and done things like matter, and feel like they belong in this ""universe"". The story grabs you, and its very noticeable how your choices, both in dialogue and otherwise will affect what your future will be like, both in the main story missions and side missions.

The game is fun to play, and something i can see myself and many others playing for a long time. The movement feels good, and so does the combat. You can spec out your character as you level up, but you can also gain some of said advantages from cybernetics, and some unique effects come only from one or the other, so you are given a lot of choices to mix and match tactics, both for open combat and doing it the stealthy way.

Cyberpunk 2077 needs some polish. One cannot look away from the fact that CD Projekt Red have had a lot of crunch, which is a very bad thing, and all in all must stop. What the game needs is; A way to change your characters appearance, a LOT more QOL for inventory and UI things, such as batch crafting and scrapping, as well as giving more things, especially sales a ""are you sure"" prompt. The UI and animation bugs also need to be fixed, but nothing ""breaks the game"" that i have found. It's a game i would recommend playing, but its hard to justify the full price as it is right now in its current state. Whether or not you should buy it, depends on how often you buy games. if they shaved 25% off it? Then i could recommend it. If you're not in a rush to play this, hold out a little longer, and get it after it's had some more love and fixing and if they add some of whats missing, then i would give it the green at full price.",True
"[b] ""Almost"" [/b]

If I had to describe this game with one word it would be ""almost"". It's almost incredible, almost delivers on the promises the devs made, almost finished, almost as good as Witcher 3... 


Visually the game can be incredible, the scale and density of the city they've built is mindblowing! But once you take a closer look you start to realize that it's just a shinny wrapping hiding a lot of issues. 

What I've played of the story so far is pretty awesome but...

[b] Almost AI:  [/b]

The densely populated city feels almost alive as long as you don't look too close, the NPCs are absolutely useless and idiotic mostly just wandering around like zombies. 

This game has some of the funniest and most idiotic game design decisions I've ever seen. Somehow they've built a futuristic city without a driving AI. Literally no NPC actually knows how to drive, the traffic is following pre-set routes and is absolutely incapable of doing something as simple as driving around an obstacle. If you leave a car on the road then all of the traffic stops for good. 

In every single car chase you're in the passenger seat, if you're lucky you'll get to shoot for a bit. They're all on-the-rails pre-scripted sequences that are almost exciting. 

It gets even funnier when you realize that [b] the police can't chase you because they don't know how to drive, [/b] they simply spawn behind your back. 2077 - the year of getting shot in the ass as soon as you commit a crime! There's no witness/reporting system either, meaning the police is instantly onto you even if nobody saw you breaking the law.

Did I mention that the game has a self-driving AI cab company, and yet no car can actually you know... drive?


[b] Almost Choices: [/b]

While the game has some actual choices here and there, the majority of the dialogue is painfully linear with most options coming down to ""Yes"", ""Angry Yes"", ""Nomad Yes"". 
The character animations and writing in the dialogue is incredible, but it's just not enough to carry what is a very light RPG system, you don't really get to define your character.

The life paths are largely cosmetic, only adding a minor dialogue option here and there, in some rare instances they do enable something useful. Which leads me to one of the most insulting things the devs pulled [b] (I don't care if this is spoilers, y'all should know before buying) [/b]

Once you finish the life path intro you get shown a montage of you and Jackie having tons of fun moments in the city. This is the footage they've used in their trailers making it seem like we'll get to experience all those things, when in reality it was just a two minute fast forward montage. This part of the game was the one I was most looking forward to, getting your bearings, setting up your relationships with people, getting to know Jackie... nope, fuck you - all you get is a montage! If this isn't false advertising, idk what is.


[b] Almost City: [/b]

Another thing you'll notice once the initial ""wow"" wears off is just how little interactivity the city has. 
- The city is filled with hundreds of food vendors who'll never sell you anything and will tell you to fuck off instead. 
- In a game where you can literally swap out your eyes, there's no option to even get a haircut or new tattoos. 
- There are no car dealerships, people just randomly send you messages with car ads and buying each car gets added to your journal as a separate mission. Feels like the hackiest solution ever, a kind of thing you would expect modders to make.
- There are tons of arcade machines, but you can't play any of them.
- You get a single apartment for the whole game, and you don't actually get to customize it however you want.
- No faction/gang system where you could develop a relationship with specific factions based on your actions.
- No trains despite the city having train stations and a rail system. 
- The idiot tier AI means that you rarely get to see any emergent and unexpected situations involving the NPCs.
- Can't call a cab and tell it to take you to your destination.


[b] TLDR; Almost worth it: [/b]

Despite all the issues the game is a lot of fun, but falls short of what we were promised (if only their dev team was as good as their PR team!). We were promised a deep RPG, instead got something closer to Far Cry, but it's not quite as coherent of an experience as FC is. My recommendation would be to [b] wait a few months for them to patch it out and then buy it at a discount.  [/b] Fingers crossed they'll do more than just squash some of the bugs!",False

+++ Incredible visuals
++   Gunplay is mostly fun, but sometimes absurd
+     Good storytelling, voice-acting & quests, 
-    Characters & their relationships can feel out of place or random
--  Sound design / mixing seems incomplete or many times missing
--  Open world is hollow, almost to the point of being exhausting (the calls & texts from fixers... my god)
--  Melee combat is stiff, not very satisfying
--- Riddled with technical issues. About 15-20% of bugs required a restart to fix. I have an i7-9700F, RTX 2080 Ti, 32GB RAM.
--- Absolutely absurd skill balance. At the hardest difficulty, by level 14 (< 20% story & side-quest completion) I was one-shotting enemies with tech rifles and handguns with over 15k headshot criticals. I'm not sure I have a bug, but every time I do the ""breach protocol"" minigame, I gain 5-7k+ money, so I've already bought most of the best gear.
--- CDPR manipulated the current game journalism ecosystem to optimize sales, ensuring the only people who could review the game were those with high-end PCs

"A game filled with disappointment from start to finish i really tried so hard to like it...

What i liked 
-Graphics
-Characters personalities
-Night City is actually beautiful
-Timed/Live dialog choice picking
-The stealth gameplay is actually fun
...........................................................................................................
What i disliked 
-Optimization  ( i played the whole run at 35 fps with dips )
-Bugs ( about 95% of game bugs i encountered in my life were all in those 58 hours alot of bugs! )
-The story it actually starts so strong but end so weak and boring 
-RPG ( Is there any really ? )
-Color pallet  (fully red map is just laziness at it highest level)
-Lightning ( There  is a lot of lightning and flashes problems in multiple quests that just hurts the eyes and the nerves and is unreasonable )
-Driving ( It's worst then driving in old ps2 era games actually true )
-Crafting is basic and boring 
..............................................................................................................
If i had to score this game it's 5 out of 10 at best even if they fixed all the bug and optimized the game, there is nothing really to invest time into the attribute and character building isn't really that extensive and the crafting is so plain the gigs are your regular kill those guys / steal something but that's just me though",False
The most beautiful bug i've ever seen s2,True
Can't even get out of the tutorial without it crashing.,False
"This game has been Great so far, really makes you just get lost in the world and immersed(Haven't even beaten act 1 yet doing side content lol). I see many people complaining of which some of these reasons are justifiable like many of the bugs and technical issues that people seem to have encountered personally i have yet to encounter one but that's just maybe because i got lucky (Due to this i really wish steam had like a numbered review system). 

However most of the negative reviews that i see for this game are people setting way too high expectations for this game, They thought that Keanu Reeves himself was going to come out the screen and suck them off while he gives them a million dollars or that the game would cure cancer.

Personally i have mainly two issues with this game but that is just from my experience. The first one is the looter shooter style of gaining new gear, it sounds cool on paper but for me personally it leads to my inventory being filled with trash weapons that i keep replacing every five seconds. I wish they would have just had a system where your level just affected the gun without all the rarity variants. The second issue i have is with the driving, I don't know what the roads are made out of in night city but it is definitely not concrete it feels like i am driving on butter or ice. Cars are sometimes are really slow to respond or turn erratically people have suggested to use a controller so i might try that see if it eases the pain. 

Overall i genuinely think this game has been amazing the most fun i have had in 2020, i personally would rate it a 8/10 based on some of the issues bringing it down.",True
Cyberpunk is a roller coaster a bit of bugs here and there a bit of crashes but what a ride !,True
"Took off my rose colored glasses... and started realizing how mediocre this game is...
Besides good graphics and a well written story there is nothing really outstanding, interesting or immersing...

Overall really bad Ai (driving, fighting, police or civilian).

Overall bad decisions were made in terms of gameplay, crafting pointless because you find better weapons almost every fight.
Also you're save file gets corrupted after to much crafting.... are you serious ?

Character creation is pointless because the only time you see your character is while driving in third person or in front of a mirror... we have ray tracing in game and i have to activate the mirror. 
The clothes you get always let you look like a homeless guy because nothing fits together or you find better armor stats on random clothes every fight.

Attributes.... well... useless in terms of player choice because there is no difference in the outcome of the mission. Neither in dialog or gameplay wise. You can answer or question slightly different but the outcome is the same...
Yes you can hack a door or straight up smash it, jump over or use the power of science to open it but if all options are for the same door it doesn't matter.
Maybe different entrances for different attributes would have somehow gave the game a bit more depth.

I could rant about this game for hours to tell what is wrong with it, how disappointed i am. I cant understand that the game has mostly positive reviews because it is not nearly what we get promised.
CDPR had my full trust on this one and failed because of greed, feature creep, mismanaging and false advertising, fear of backlash in the community, shareholders when delaying more.

You became a studio what once was ""pro consumer"" to the shady greedy corporations you made a game about, congrats and welcome to the dark side...

"Not bad, not great either. Neutral for me.",True
Yeah it's good,True
"Tricky one. 
I'm enjoying this game enough to resent anything which takes my time away from it, but it definitely has it's issues. Bugs of course, but we expected that and at least the company was honest about it, unlike Bethesda who can go directly to hell. 
The side missions are engaging as is the main quest. Anyone reporting a short campaign is obviously rushing through as quickly as they can, and not doing any of the extra content. 
The writing is generally good, though there are a few moments throughout where you can tell different writers came in with different ideas and perhaps a few conflicting ideas were left in. In general though, the stories are good and the characters make sense. *Some* of the acting leaves a little to be desired, but to be honest I'm constantly surprised that people seem to have forgotten that Keanu is not actually a very good actor.
Combat is perhaps a little too rudimentary - more work is required. A.I. is too easy to trick, and the in game economy is pay-to-win, which is fine except that money is pretty easy to come by. It did not take long before in combat hacking made short work of all enemies. 
That said, hacking enemies is super fun, and the super-jump-cyber-legs are far too much fun. Also, I have electric gorilla arms. 'Nuff said. 
I have a mid-powered gaming machine and it handles things fine, though I'm not on max quality by any means. I don't really see the point of this ray-tracing nonsense. Anyone paying that much attention to in-game reflections needs to reassess their lives, I think. 
I've played for 35 hours at the time of writing, I feel that I am perhaps 1/5 of the way through the game, and I'm looking forward to the rest.

"Game runs at around 50fps on my PC with a RTX 2060 and Ryzen 5 2600x. 
Mix of low med and high settings, 1440, DLSS on auto. 
No bugs so far. 
But, I really wish steam had a meh review option, as for accessibility reasons I cant fully recommend it at this point. The game would be pretty much unplayable for me without steam input, and even that has issues. Using steam input to map keyboard and mouse buttons does not work therefore you are stuck with remapping controls to the ONE controller profile the profile the game has. After around two hours I finally got a steam input mapping set up that works well for me, but I shouldnt have to spend so long on that. Button remapping is a basic feature and can greatly help in making games more accessable. I really expected better from this game. A PC game of this caliber with such a wide audience should have best in class options for accessibility, but currently this game is pretty much as bad in that regard as some super niche JRPG PC ports. Those almost always get destroyed in reviews for this, yet people are giving CD Projekt Red, a much bigger studio a pass. Dissapointing.",False

"Here's my spoiler-free review of Cyberpunk after 100%-ing the game and completing all endings. 

I've always had an affinity for the Dystopian Future/Cyberpunk genre and I followed CP2077's development pretty closely. It's completely fair to say that this game has plenty of shortcomings, these primarily being NPC AI, limited lifepath diversity, bugs, & the limited player customisation. 

However, 

These things are all pretty passable for me personally and for most people who are playing on PC. I haven't had a single-player experience akin to this since I first played Skyrim. 

- No other game comes close to CP2077 in terms of scenery and imagery, it's beautifully crafted and I would say is the focal point of the game, I've never been so invested or immersed in a world like this. 

- The side-characters of the game are incredibly polished each with their own personalities, backgrounds & goals. Interaction with them is also a major highlight of the game, they feel very real and their associated quests are compelling and you actually feel for them.

- The main story of the game is short but very impactful, I constantly wanted to unravel more and the choices you make in side quests and with side-characters can shape how your story plays out in the long run. It keeps you hooked and there are numerous iterations of endings which gives it decent replay value. 

- It's pretty clear that CDPR took a lot of time creating the soundtrack for this game, there are a plethora of songs on the radio that are all unique and are fitting to the Cyberpunk genre, some of the pieces for the main story are also unbelievable, I personally enjoyed Rite of Passage, Isometric Air, Kerry's Guitar Theme & [spoiler]Johnny's Grave[/spoiler]

There are plenty more things for me to talk about but I would 100% recommend CP2077 to any PC player and I think in the coming months with patches, DLC & (hopefully) modding support the game will become a masterpiece.",True
"To preface this review, my PC is above the recommended spec's CDPR released and I was playing on mostly low/medium settings.

Okay so... the game is amazingly unoptimised with countless graphical errors and weird bugs. I get very constant frame drops, blurry environments and weird 'shadowy' trails left behind moving cars and NPC's (who by the way have pretty awful AI). Starting off the game I was met with a superb amount of black shrubbery drawing over everything else on my screen that was only fixed by turning my settings from High -> Medium. Can't recommend the game in it's current state and would suggest holding off buying it until it's patched into the game that was promised to begin with.

game was refunded anyway so the only thing I lost was the time spent 'playing' it.",False
4/5 ei maistu salami,True
"At the time of writing this review I feel like I’m the only person who likes this game. It’s had too many controversies, it’s riddled with bugs, poorly optimised and some people saying it even looks bad artistically. I have seen and interacted with all these things in game and I am easily willing to admit they exist as I’ve seen them in the game. My pc can barely run the game smoothly nor well enough to render what’s infront of me if I jog out of the area I was in.

Having second wave home sickness hit like a freight train and being away from a place that is constantly critiqued and torn apart for what a shitty (crappy [in case it gets censored]) state it’s in can obviously be heart breaking especially when their all true and horrible to see happen in the world today. The game may not feel the same for you but the state it’s in kills me when it just keeps getting torn further and further apart as it feels like an attack on me even though the comment has nothing to do with me, there’s no winning either, if I defend it I feel like a racist or I just let it go on I feel like I’m only adding to the fire and these things feel the same for the country I call home.

Yeah this game is probably garbage and I’m probably garbage for liking it but driving in a car on a large open highway with the radio on in the pouring rain just gives me just a little hope that the place I call home might change and be just as good as I remember it being and not the political hellscape it is, like this game.

"I did not pick the game up at launch especially hearing all of the horror stories but I am sincerely glad that I did end up buying the game and playing it just a few weeks after. It took me on a 146 hour ride, that has left me wanting even more. Well written, well acted, good graphics, fun game play, all sorts of story lines. There are bugs but none of them ended up breaking the game for me. Despite not always agreeing with the choices made available to me as a player character I still enjoyed the way that the story was hashed out. An excellent game that I truly hope to see more content made for. Loved Judy's character as well as the Nomads. A truly great story line with what looks to have plenty of room to grow. I rarely write reviews for games but absolutely felt the need to after having completed Cyberpunk 2077. Was not disappointed in the least considering I went into the game without much in the way of expectations. Keanu Reaves is great at playing the struggling dramatic artist role. Carla Tassara, the English voice actress for Judy, is excellent and convincing. All of the main characters are well acted. The writing for the characters adds to the immersion by never seeming out of place or distracting with poor implementation. Not being able to hide some of the side quests after a while gets annoying, especially if you are not interested in completing them. Vehicles that you unlock as available to buy also clutter the map and are looked at kind of like side quests which may drive some completionists insane. Finally, some of Night Cities newness wears off by the time you reach the end of the game but that is what has left me just wanting more for this game. The lack of end game content I am hoping is resolved as it would just add more replay-ability to the game. Overall I was greatly impressed and have a new favorite for sure.",True

"This will be a spoiler free review!

First of all to address the cybernetically enhanced elephant in the room:
There are alot of bugs in the current state of the game. Many are funny, some are annoying and only a few are really game or quest breaking.
Some bugs I have encountered:
- T-Poses and Clothing missing on NPCs and the Player
- Some doors only opening after a quick reload
- Getting stuck on small objects
- Police officers teleport in front of you to chase you
- A quest forcing a side even if it was planned to give a choice
- Some sounds cut out or play until a reload
There were some times where I wanted to quit the game as the bugs were in too quick succession and too annoying to continue. But most of the time I could play hours on end without any problems.

For a perspective in performance: I am running a GTX 1070 and a Ryzen 9 3900X. Currently on Patch 1.06 I have 50fps most of the time (medium/1080p), but it feels smooth and not really noticeable in game. The graphics are stunning and I can't really see much differences between medium and high settings and it never crashed once. The load times are only a few seconds at best (running an SSD, hard drive is not recommended at all, the pop in is just too often with HDDs and isn’t really playable).

I’ve noticed while creating the character that some colors are not really consistent. White hair in the menu looks greenish on the character and red hair looks more pinkish outside of the editor in the “real” city. It is annoying to know that what you see in the editor isn’t what you get in the game. I needed to recreate my character 3 to 4 times to get the perfect look. It does not help that there are way too few possibilities to choose from in my opinion for an rpg game in the editor.

The story is entertaining but maybe a bit too streamline for me. The game controls the story for the most part and not you. The main story is quite short in comparison with Witcher 3 but the game excels in the side stories, gigs and the futuristic atmosphere.

The game world looks breathtaking, but if you dig into it, it becomes sadly little less stunning. There isn’t much else to do outside of quests. Sure you can drive through the city, see crimes in which you can intervene and go shopping, but most doors are closed and many objects can not be interacted with (e.g. You can not sit on a free bench in the city, the train system is just a fancy fast travel point, and so on). The main attraction of the city is the atmosphere, not the “real” life part of Night City. That would be great additions in future updates, when the main bug- and performance fixes are out.

The game is great if you are looking at the story and quest side but lacks the open world aspects I know and love in games like Witcher 3 or GTA V.

To the combat and perks system: I mainly drive a Katana and Mantis Blades as the melee aspect of the game is great and feels just fantastic. I’ve tried ranged weapons once or twice or as a fallback, but in my opinion Cyberpunk does not excel as a first person shooter. The only weapon I liked to shoot was Johnny’s pistol which almost one shot everyone.
The perk system is great but overwhelming at first. There are many perks to choose from and a lot of skills to master in different categories. You can level 5 attributes with their own skills and play styles associated with them.

All in all the game is great and worth the time and wait. Although I admit CDPR hasn’t released a 100% finished game, there needs to be a lot more work done. But Witcher 3 was not the great game at release either. Some games need time to get good. If you want to play Cyberpunk 2077 I recommend you wait some more time and buy it in a few months from now to get the best experience. If you can’t wait any longer, buy it now. It is more than enjoyable today, but the bugs can lower fun and enjoyment a bit.",True
"Having completed 4/5 endings and completed 100% of the side-missions in the game, I cannot recommend this until CDPR improves the base playability.

While the story is decent, and can even be quite engaging at times, the amount of bugs are massive, and range from small visual glitches to issues that will require reloads/restarts to resolve.

There comes a point where you start to wonder if wading through the chest-high flood of issues is worth the slog to unwrap the story at all.

Finally, the amount of variation in the options for the endings feels lacking. While the situations and missions do differ in the playstyle and length, the ending options basically always boil down the two familiar options (barring one or two variations).

As a personal gripe, I would also say that a majority of the endings can be rather grim, even if you've really gone out of your way to ensure you've done/seen/resolved all the gigs, side-jobs and missions on the map. The lack of agency in the endings is a bit disappointing considering that some choices you do make throughout the game do have relevant impacts during your play-through.

I won't say that I did not enjoy parts of this game, but it would be better to wait for some patches to come in and resolve the worst of the issues, so that the actual missions and character development can be enjoyed without constant distracting glitches or immersion-breaking bugs.",False

"=Dialogue/VA=
Pointless dialogue choices, VA is serviceable.

=Sounds=
When they work, they are OK. They fail to communicate damage received or dealt.

=Music= 
Enjoyable though nowhere near as identifiable as Deus Ex's OST or the Syndicate Wars one, it lacks a haunting Sci-Fi Cyber feel of a Dystopian Hell scape of a city. Combat music is tiring after hearing the same track 10 times in a row.

=GamePlay=
Vehicle handling is terrible, on foot V some times feels clunky depending on the environment. Combat feels impactless, like an inferior version of BorderLands, regardless of weapons. Melee much more so.

Stat/Perk system offering a pseudo RPG approach on top of all that, making it a mess when it comes to firing weapons and slashing at enemies. Even throwing Grenades feels off.
Whether dealing or receiving damage, the only clue about it is how much flickering there is.

For no reason at all, V has to fight against forced camera changing when driving over certain speeds. It can be nauseating.

CP's equivalent of Spells/Casting is Hacking during combat. I believe it is highly subjective whether that's good or not, but what I can criticize is that enemies using it against V is highly annoying and effective.

Stealth is basic. Some times it will feel completely irrelevant, some times it will feel completely OP.

Here is where I will also mention that CP should have been a 3rd Person camera game, not a First Person one. There is no doubt about it. This choice by CDPR is baffling, outright stupid I should say.

=Unique Elements= 
Brain-Dance; ""Zoom and Enhance"" turned into a Mini-Game. It is boring and tiring for the eyes, potentially able to cause seizures even.

=Looting/Selling/Making $/Fun Side-Content/Mini-Games/Activities/Interactions=
Either non existent or boring. Mostly non existent- What a shame, considering what CP is supposed to be, supposed to do.

=Difficulty=
Easy and Normal are too easy; Next options are too hard and enemies become absurdly dangerous solely because of their extreme HP pools and damage.

=AI=
The AI is incapable of anything except relying on their health and damage(Depending on Difficulty) to beat relentlessly on V. 

The crowd system is broken, NPC drivers are broken as well.

=UI=
Offensively bright contrasting colours, screen flicker, intentional distortions, the most cumbersome dialogue option select system to date, convoluted menu system. The HUD is unimaginative. Map, Mini-Map, GPS and all that are a terrible mess of minimal functionality and customization.

=Options/Tech=
I play on an I9 with 32 RAM and an 2080, it can handle 2K with all settings on Ultra but RTX turned off(Because I find it 100% pointless). I don't see how the game would be enjoyable for anyone running it on a weaker system, since even as it is on mine, it lacks style and the only thing that saves it is the lip stick. Neon blinding glow on EVERYTHING is not style nor artistic.

The options for key binding are limited.

Animation wise, CyberPunk delivers- When it's not glitching.

=World/Environment/World Building/Visual Story Telling=
CP is not CyberPunk, it's a strange mix of RetroWave/FuturePop/1998's Vision Of The Future, with references to material it doesn't deserve to touch on(And which it doesn't beyond nostalgic references). Comparing it with the Deus Ex franchise it falls short on the CyberPunk department. It's like that Carl Urban ""Dredd"" movie except there is no fancy building, no Carl Urban, just heaps of trash in a drab world lit up with pointless neon glow.

The origin stories make no sense except for Street Kid, and that's the story you'll be playing essentially, even if you pick differently. To point out an example of that, why is Corporate V even bothering with Jackie's family ETC? That's stuff you would expect from the Street Kid story- Participating in that funeral, acting like a gang member ETC. Another example; Why is V not already highly skilled as Corporate?

Tons of other examples can be found. When we talk about world building, we talk about the world in which V will be adventuring and what stories it tells, separate from all the quests. There are no stories here except in Data Logs, just like Skyrim books. World building then, is on the same level as the Need For Speed or the Fast And Furious franchises, in that it is all about setting up deals with gangs and racing from one point to the next to fetch, kill or escort. 
Essentially anything beyond story related questing is bare bones GTA except you can't enjoy it, for reasons I mentioned above or will mention below.

I should add that just like its pointless neon glow, much of the visual story telling leads to nothing interesting at all. Implants are just there, glows are just there. There is no further exploration for the wandering eye and mind.

In the end, very little is touched on- Soul, Humanity, gender, existential dilemmas, preferences, consequences, ideals- Thrown out of the window and replaced with neon. There are bits and pieces here and there but just like I said, CP is not capable of juggling with such subjects and it shows. V won't be contested in terms of ideals, morals, preferences, sexuality, appearance, origins, choices. Such wasted potential.

=Character/Car Customization/Skills=
Gender is tied to voice? Only 2 voices? 200 nail options though. No car customization. No weapon and gear cosmetic customization. Nothing at all, not even colours. Character can be customized to a rich extend, except in all the wrong ways. Skins for weapons and gears so you don't look like a clown? Nothing. 

As for Skills/Abilities, it's easy to exploit this linear and predictable skill system, Min/Max is too easy to do and does pay off. As such I find it shallow and boring, especially for the first 15-20 levels.

=Story=
I would say depending on how many movies you've watched, how many books you've read and how many songs you've listened to, the story can range from tedious, dragging and predictable to novel, fresh and immersive. I can't criticize it except from my subjective POV. Having grown up in the 80's-90's, the story to me is the prior... Predictable, but ""OK"" at the same time. 

I absolutely despise forced crews and comrades, I despise ""People in your Head"" kind of stories(Admittedly there are exceptions), I despise fractured story telling(Chronologically), this is not for me. 

The meat of the story is that V steals an implant that then has to plug in to preserve it, which back fires causing V to have to race to fix things. I won't say more but don't expect much more either. It could have been done much better, it could have been surrounded by much better content but on its own it's serviceable I suppose, depending on personal experience with material like that.

=GrApHiCS=
The GFX are really good, it's 2020, it doesn't care what it costs you but I'll be damned if the game doesn't look objectively good. Not stylish, not visionary, not innovative. Moving on...

=Quality/Price=
CP feels like it went through 20 different Dev teams, got scrapped about 3-4 times, was rushed, cut and announced way too soon. I do not feel it deserves a full price, it's a glorified GTA mod and is on the same levels as base Skyrim in terms of production quality, it is riddled with minor glitches that pile up and wreck immersion. This should be Early Access/Kick-Started and should stay there for another 1-2 years, for around 10-20 Euro in case it wasn't free for the time being.

Some elements of CP seem to have been ripped off directly from other titles. I won't elaborate, all that is required is a pair of eyes. Whether that was intentional or meant to be used only as a base for artists but then CP was rushed, I don't know. It's worth mentioning either way, in my opinion.",False

"Cyberpunk 2077 is a beautiful game. The setting is stunning. The story is gripping. The characters are lasting. It achieves, from a narrative perspective, everything a big title like this should strive for. There were so many moments I was enraptured thinking, ""this is fantastic."" 

However, all the criticism the game gets is warranted. CD PROJEKT RED launched a big title while it was unfinished. Many of the simple game mechanics like driving, A.I. detection, and stealth were solved years ago by titles like GTA. It's frankly unacceptable for a company to release such a buggy hot-mess.

I have a very good PC and before patch 1.1, I crashed almost every time I launched the game. I would be driving fine and then BOOM- 5 FPS forever. I realize that these issues are going to be corrected by the DEV team, but I can't say I support the business decision to launch a half ass game. No Man's Sky got away with it because they literally tripled the scope of the game after launch, but that precedent can't be maintained by the industry at large.

It seriously hurts me to, but I cannot recommend the game in its current state. There are so many unfinished systems. For example, crafting takes up nearly 1/5 of the leveling options for your character, but it is nearly impossible to find a variety of blueprints. When I ended the game, I think I had maybe 20 craftable end game items. Issues like this rippled through hundreds of systems in the game took me out of the setting more times than it brought me in. Most of the things I typically tolerate in a game such as grindy side quests or unskippable content were intolerable because I was already bogged down by broken game mechanics.

I respect the direction the art team was going in and applaud both the soundtrack and writing team, but I give to thumbs down to the corporate hacks that pushed CD PROJEKT RED to release unfinished.",False
"First of all, I haven't had too much issues with bugs, just a few graphical ones and ofcourse the awful pedestrian AI, they haven't really inspired me to make a negative review.

The reason why I wouldn't recommend CP2077 is because the game is honestly boring. It's just not fun, it's uninspiring and everytime I boot it up I play for a bit and then I dread through in order to find a good spot to save and quit. Nothing makes me want to play it other than the fact the game was hyped up a lot and the fact I SHOULD be liking games like these as I tend to like these kinds of games.

My biggest issues has to do with the actual RPG mechanics of the game, and especially with the character progression on it's own, leveling up isn't exciting, at all. Perks don't feel significant whatsoever, only increasing dmg or reload or something similiar by a few %, I find it much more exciting to make builds in games like Skyrim or Fallout where I can actually customize my playstyle. Cyberware SOMEWHAT does this, but barely, and the more exciting cyberware is sooo expensive or locked behind progression(street cred).

On top of all this, with most RPGs I look at the replayability and how comfortable the game is to play again, (now I don't even feel like finishing this one so that should say most of my opinions on Cyberpunks replayability.) Cyberpunk not only isn't exciting to progress as your character but there's so, muuuuuch dialogue, most of it pointless and can be best compared to Fallout 4 where there is only an illusion of choice. Even skipping dialogue is annoying since there's a quick cutscene EVERYTIME you skip a SENTENCE of dialogue. They also have 3 different starting zones which are supposed to influence your character, and you will get some extra dialogues here and there, but it mostly feels pointless as well.

All in all, Cyberpunk is just not fun, that's it, it's average, the bugs will be fixed and it will be an average game then too.",False
"Yeah, the game was buggy at launch, but I can feel it becoming more and more stable with each patch we get and  at this point the game is already amazing.",True

Yeah bro GOTY for sure",False
Best game I've played in a while,True
"expectations vs reality: 

These points are what has been going though my mind within the past few days of cyberpunk's release. Like many gamers i've been watching for this game's release for the past few years and although it isnt everything I thought it would be. I do want to say i really enjoy what made it into the game. 

I came to suspect the title to have great graphics, a good story and hopefully great gameplay. I can say with great enthusiasm that the game does have that! The RTX effects made this game look amazing in 4k. the story is worth your time if you can get though some of the technical issues ( which thankfully, my system did ok! not the best but keep in mind i had the RTX settings on and dlss 2.0 that everyone should have on! )  

Story: I'm a big fan of the cyberpunk genre. Ghost in the shell is a all time fav of mines since i was a teen. its dark, gritty, sometimes creepy and this game nails that vibe. its a slow burn at the start but it doesnt  feel boring thanks to the moment to moment storytelling method  from as far back to the half life games.  You are V. living in the moment as a mercenary . a hired gun with a past made in your own choosing. much like the choices that lies head of you.  so do be careful! 

Graphics:  The red engine may have its issues. but the amount of effort put into catching the noisy, cramped, robotic busting streets of night city is  presented greatly.  there are some points are wallpaper worthy. Having an RTX card and some loss in frames was worth it! ill never forget the style of  this game.

the gameplay : its a mix of borderlands, deux ex, and a bit of gta. Character customization and optimization is fleshed out to all hell. you can replace your limbs with blades. hack almost everything if you have the build for it. Turn you legs into soild metal to take less fall damage. or get a robo arm and punch the crap out of anyone that gets in your way. the world feels lived in. even if half of it is covered in trash. if you love to explore the crap out of big open worlds. this game won't disappoint you there........but the ai will. 

 My Big Disappointment:  The Ai and how it interacts with you is awful. most dont have the need to even track you during some combat missions. they're run in circles and barely use any  tactics but occasionally hack you. The game has the look of a next gen title but yet have i seen something that rivals the ai from halo 1.  It makes most fights a push over even on very hard. ( which is what i beat this game on first try.)   you can commit some awful crimes and barely have reinforcements come after you. you wantto max out cred with pure ease. do it with the best gear you got.  but thats not all. The interaction with ai outside of main story characters and romance options leaves alot to be desire. Remember in GTA 5 where you can not only pay a chick to have sex with you. but you can do it in your car in real time. not in this game sadly. in fact, if you want to have romance choices outside of the story ones. this is going to be quite the let down. CD made alot of hype out of romance options and most of the time it feels limited.  



TLDR: Its a ok game to me. but not the 2nd coming at all.  for all the good stuff like combat, graphics with RTX and Fleshed out customization and story. the AI, and SHIT tons of bugs holds it back hard. the game could of used more time in the oven. ( i got games put on hold to play though this one. so i dont mind.)  the game feels half baked sadly and i hope this teaches gamers alot of lessons on pre ordering a game before its REALLY finished.",True

"Waited 8 years without high expectations. Enjoyable game that's rough around the edges but that's to be expected in this day and age sadly. For me it was overall a good ride and I'll probably do a couple more runs. If you're interested in the game, try it yourself and form your own opinions of it. It does need a good rig so beware of that.
I received Cyberpunk 2077 as a gift and an amazing gift it was but it doesn't skew my opinion on this game.",True
"I have a ryzen 3900x and RTX 2070SUPER on a 1440p monitor; and I get 50-65fps with High graphics + RTX medium. My previous review was incorrect and am sorry for it. But lemme explain, I tweaked with the graphics settings too much in game and that somehow tanked my fps to 20. After restarting the game fps became fine again. Probably to apply newly changed graphics settings, you need to restart the game.

The gameplay isn't as fun as I expected though. I expected some next level immersive side quest like Skyrim's but better. So, far they are kinda bland. Hacking feels like Watch Dogs games. The car handling could have been better. And of course the glitches. I hope they will be fixed soon.

So my suggestion is, emm if you are really picky don't get it right now. Get it once it's fixed. Also it needs powerful hardware atm, so if you don't have top end rig; maybe wait for the game to have more optimizations. Else you can get it.",True

The only settings giving a boost being Volumetric Fog and ambient occlusion

Wait till patch sorts out the performance issues otherwise you might as well play on console",False
"TLDR - there's nothing revolutionary in this game and it is not as dynamic as trailers show. Game is a a bunch of interactive movie episodes and could be dissapointing after a learning curve since you can't do any impact on how story developes. 
You'll just have to go through all the predesigned steps. Expect the Witcher 3 in the 'Johny Mnemonic' (movie from 1995) setting.


Nice entertainment, but polish programming haven't involved since the Witcher 3 times (I prefer Skyrim over the Witcher). 
And the world is not immersive due to tons of stoppers - logical inconsistency and overal the gamepace is slow. Storilynes and dialoges are mostly boring and can cause facepalming. If you've played the Witcher, you've seen that.

The game not decision driven, you're given no options in dialoges (chose the order you say things in, but it won't change the result), except for skills-related. Im general purpose of dialogues is to learn about some story details and you can chose to start  or to avoid the fight over dialogues (or be a tought guy before the fight).

But to avoid collisions with traffic (wich is under their control) and chose speed they'll need a software engineer or a good programmer wich they don't have.

Game design is full of crutches - objects spawn  from 3-4 meters above surface as soon as you look in a direction they're attached to and then drop. It causes funny and not so funny collisions, also triggered cops will always spawn in numbers around you whereever you go.. Pedestrians' AI doesn't aware there vehicles are. Pedestrians are clonned - you can see two copies walking towards each other. You can look at the pretty girl on the other side of crosswalk, turn away, and there would be a bearded guy in the spot she was at a moment ago. If you look away in dialogue and then look again - the person's model would drop down with physics effects on their hair and bodyparts (they don't even store models in environment during a simple dialogue).
They even have invisible walls in some locations to prevent you from climbing mountains. You can't drive over garbage bags in junkyard location, because they have such attributes to them that concrete blocks don't have.. and many more.

Buy it for the great architecture and some stealth/action short missions.",True
"[h1]Dissapointed[/h1]
That is the sole word that comes to mind when I think of Cyberpunk 2077. To be fair, I didn't expect it to be the greatest game of all time, but I did hope for an above average game. After almost a hundred hours, a bunch of side quests, and experiencing all of the endings, I feel like this game wasn't anything progressive, and leaves much to be desired.
[h2]Scale and Atmosphere[/h2]
I won't lie, Night City is the shining point of this game. The overall scope and density of the city is one of the things this game did right. In the opening free sections of the game, I found myself just completely lost in this massive city, just one little person among thousands. Getting to play this game with higher settings is real eye candy due to all of the colorful lights and dark shadows the city has. The real big drawback are the NPCs, they just feel lifeless and half the time cower in fear cause you accidentally bumped into them. I always look for a way to feel like I am in the game that I am playing and Cyberpunk does just that. 
[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
The gameplay is very solid and works great for me. If you've played games like Borderlands or Far Cry, you should feel right at home here. I played through the game as a Stealthy Netrunner type of character and it was a joy to create new and powerful quick hacks that are fun to play with. The ability to approach the side gigs however you want is addictive and it always keeps the game fun, because the game is in [b]YOUR[/b] control. Upgrading cyberware is a real treat too, as you can get some pretty sick upgrades to feel like a beast. However, this game adapts looter shooter mechanics having you loot the same guns and armor constantly just because they do a higher damage, or it has higher armor, and it bugs the shit out of me of how lazy this all feels. Also, there is no sort of Transmog system in this game, which is just flat out unacceptable. So what if the game is in first person? There are still various ways to see your character in the game, and I think everyone would prefer not to look like a complete troglodyte!
[h2]Main Story[/h2]
This is where this game let me down the most. I can't believe there are so many people out there who say this is the saving grace of this game, I just think it's flat out rushed and uninteresting. I won't spoil anything, but I will say that I forced myself to finish the main questline. I didn't end up beating the game until my 90 hour mark, because I had no desire to even do it. This story had moments where it could have taken off, but I feel like the devs were rushed and didn't bother giving it more life or fleshing it out. The on-the-rails, overly-scripted shooting segments are just flat out embarrassing, is this a serious RPG, or a Call of Duty campaign?? Nothing memorable or really remarkable, I'll easily forget it in a month or two. This story was way too [i]short[/i] for a game this size. There are other things that I will discuss that add to this lackluster story below. 
[h2]Characters[/h2]
To keep this short, 90% of the characters in this game are just plain boring. I felt [b]zero[/b] emotional connection to them, and only really talked to the side ones just so I can do their quests, get the xp, and move on. There are so many times where the game wants you to care about these people that you meet, but they're just uninteresting, and there's just so minimal relationship building done between V and them. Seriously, it feels like most characters you meet in this game just automatically becomes your close friend. Like Jackie, I literally had a dialogue option to tell him that I could get to Night City on my own(Nomad btw), and the game just says NOPE and forces him to become my best friend through a short ass montage. What a joke! Just like the story, not enough time was put in enough to these characters.
[h2]RPG???[/h2]
This, this is probably the worst part of the game. CD PROJEKT RED advertised this game to be a full-fledged RPG. Yeah. NOPE. This game is one of the most casual/minimalist RPGs I have ever played. I'm sorry if I was expecting a lot more, but this is as casual and basic as they fucking come. I hardly feel like I am role-playing the character that I really wanted to be. This isn't your story, this is V's. I felt so out of connection with my V that it just felt like I wasn't playing the character that I created. Now one might say: ""oH BuT WhAt aBoUt tHe sKiLl tReEs? ThE SkIlL ChEcKs? ThE DiAlOgUe oPtIoNs?"" All of those are just equally a let down as the rest of the game. 
[h2]Skills, Skill Checks & Speech[/h2]
To add to the ""rpg"" aspect of the game, Cyberpunk has a bunch of skills that can be earned through leveling. I will say that these trees are fine and I felt they did their job respectfully. Most of them just upgrade how fast you can hack, or how much damage you do with melee, etc. However, now comes the point where those skills get put into skill check sections, and this just straight up pathetic. Pretty much all of the ""skill checks"" in this game do NOTHING! I've reloaded saves and tried out outcomes with and without the successful skill check and they pretty much lead to the SAME outcome. A successful skill check most of the time results in an extra line or two of dialogue. The most disgraceful skill checks are the ones that you pass, but the game literally tells you to fuck yourself. For example, there is a quest where you need to purchase this quest item off a dealer. The game presents a skill check for a certain attribute that you need a certain amount of points spec'd into to ask the dealer for a discount. I had enough spec'd points to ask him and the response I got was, ""Go fuck yourself"". Pathetic, I feel like that was a message from the devs to players like me hoping for my skills to actually have an effect on my character, sorry for wanting something that's in practically every RPG. Basically, your skills are only tied to how buffed you want your character to be with certain weapons, or hacking, that's it. Then comes speech, which is one of the most important parts of an RPG in my opinion. The speech options in this game are minimal and don't really do anything to the story. You may invoke a different emotion from a character depending on your dialogue option, but they quickly snap back into whatever you were talking about. 
[h2]Life Path & Story Choices[/h2]
Yet another half-baked aspect of the game. Your life-path? Practically meaningless, especially for Nomads like myself. I didn't expect the life-paths to be anything crazy like change the entire game, but man the life-paths are really just an illusion in this game. Once you're done with the incredibly short intro mission for your life-path you are pretty much at the same point as everyone else in the game. The Nomad intro was just flat out terrible as you're only in the badlands for such a short amount of time, to the point where I don't feel like I am a Nomad, I'm just a Nomad because the game is telling me that I am. From then on, your life-path is only relevant through meaningless dialogue options with other characters. All I wanted was a much stronger start for the life-path, perhaps with characters that you can interact with that are exclusively met in specific life paths, which isn't asking for too much. Then comes the ""choices"". I already discussed the disappointing speech choices, but when it comes to choices that shape your character, there really isn't any, once again making this a bare bone RPG. There are times when you can choose to kill or save a certain character, and the outcome isn't anything substantial. 

[b]There was A LOT more I wanted to type but there is a character limit for steam reviews that I had no clue existed. To end, I would like to state that this game ISN'T bad, it's just overly disappointing for what was advertised. I still think this is a game you should buy if interested, but if you're an RPG fan, you will be dissapointed[/b]",False

++ Amazing Base & Setting

- Optimization problems
-- Open World conceiving, and RPG aspect balance.

It still have the chances to be a really great RPG game! It however have it very hard to be ""the next step on Open World Conceiving"" and tbh it have some design problems related to the RPG aspect that I really did not expect from CD project (meanwhile the other things were expected by me)

There is nothing to date to believe the game will not get nice support by CD project Red, maybe even the Open World Concept could get more solid with important patches (or expansion sets) however, I would not take it as something safe.

If you are not an RPG enthusiastic, dont have a good gaming system to handle the game well or you just have too many doubts related to the game, I really suggest you to wait till February - March, when the game will be on a way better state for the average gamer.

"Horrendous optimization, think for a second here. This game had marketing in the form of CP2077 branded 2080TIs. Those same GPUs likely only run this game at a 1440p mark at 30fps with ray tracing on which is the CORE GIMMICK of an RTX gpu. DLSS is the only way you can get this game to run adequately without turning down almost every eye-candy setting. I weep for the people without RTX cards

The pc version seems like a console port to pc. There is a quicksave key but I do not even know what the fuck the quickload key is. I've also noticed a very frequent audio crackling which should NOT be happening on a 3700x. The majority of the graphical settings also have to do with post-processing effects. The weapon wheel is also made for controllers in mind whereas you point the stick in the direction of whatever weapon you want to pick, there is no cursor for selection with KB+M. 

This game is horribly competently yet at the same time incompetently made. It showed so much promise while failing to deliver on the majority of it. You can shoot civilians and cops the same and then waltz back into your apartment and the cops just fuck off. The combat feels janky, guns are largely unsatisfying and melee feels clunky. The graphical fidelity of this game reminds me of FF7R where sometimes it looks great and sometimes dull. Cops also seem to spawn in wherever you aren't looking. When driving through the street, NPCs and other various entities just pop in. I've played 5 hours of the game now and there doesnt seem to be much in terms of build variation. The backgrounds(nomad, street kid, corpo) so far just seem to give you the choice of an extra line of dialogue to choose from sometimes and varying how the start of the game goes. The game seems to want to be an RPG but it largely comes in the form of stat allocation to whatever guns you want to use. The game just seems to be more open-world dreck that doesn't innovate or ""push boundaries"". 

This game is made unlike a legitimate passion project. It feels like they just rode off of the hype they built for nearly a decade and ticked off the criteria for what some people would want in an open-world ""cyberpunk"" themed game. I do not recommend this in it's current state. Torrent this because they were nice enough to have it on gog. Maybe mods will make it better eventually

Disappointing. I'm only playing through this because I figure I may as well see what else this game has to offer maybe it'll do something I like, but I highly doubt it. At the very least, this gives me something to waste time on",False
"So heres the thing. I played through the entire game, did all the side stuff, and got through the game without any crashes or game breaking bugs, and I still hate this game. The greatest flaw for me is literally the main focus of it. I HATE johnny Silverhand.

SPOILERS

From the second your character gets blasted in the head, the game becomes hollow and you completely lose agency as a player to actually want to fulfill anything. Wanna bro-down with the best supporting character I've seen in a game in a while? Sorry, we killed him off an hour in. Wanna get personal revenge on your antagonist? Sorry, someone else killed him for you. Wanna survive and remove that malfunctioning chip from your head? Too bad, you always die in the end. Are wondering what your purpose in the game is anymore? Got you covered. You're gonna spend the rest of the game doing what Johnny Silverhand wants you to do now, and he will complain and harass you at every opportunity until you do it.

When I talked to my friends about why they disliked the game, they mentioned that fact that they had a hard time getting invested in the world. And I agree, because every time I was trying to get focused on what i'm doing, Sneaking through some high security base, or trying to admire a hand crafted set piece, there was Johnny Suckhand saying ""HEY OVER HERE!"" ""HEY LOOK AT THIS!"" ""GO THIS WAY!"".

By the end, I found myself literally doing the opposite of decisions that I probably would have made, just because characters (Johnny especially) kept popping up and telling me what decisions I should be making instead. There was a moment where he appeared and told me that if I didn't get into a car he would never talk to me again, and then I blew the car up and intentionally failed the quest because I was really hoping he would go away.

I tried all 3 background choices as well, and only one of them felt like it was well written. The other two felt like they were quickly added to give the illusion of choice. I feel like this game use to be VERY different at one point. Like it had a totally different plot and you actually did have choices that mattered. But they put too much money in star power and made the game really linear to justify their investment.

If CD Project Red releases DLC for this game, I hope it adds a new main plot that doesn't make the player a side character in their own story",False
"I never got on board with all the hype for this game. I decided to buy this on a whim an hour before release. No expectation but had heard all about the endless delays and how it was the next big 'can it run Crysis' etc

I got through the main story line in about 25 hours game play. I'm back running through all the side missions at present but tbh I found the whole thing very underwhelming. 

I'd been reading about bugs in the game but had only had 2 biggish ones during missions on my end.. but as I progressed through I started seeing more and more. One happened when during a big break into a huge warehouse mission happened where all the npc's seem to freeze but kept using voice dialog and never attacked me so for this mission I just walked past about 20 guards and out the front door.

The worst bug I think I saw was one of the last fights against one of the main 'bad guys' where he seemed to get stuck on a railing and was still active but couldn't target me. So this fight was just me shooting him in the face until he died.. super anticlimactic!!! 

Outside of the endless bugs I keep coming across as I play more and more I just found the whole game to be very by the book. To me it was like back playing an updated GTA. Yes it looks great and with my set up (AMD) I was getting an average 100 fps on all max settings. But it doesn't matter how good it looks when overall  the game itself isn't exactly amazing.

Some of the dialog scenes reaaaaly drag on, I found my engagement levels drop drastically after some weak dialog and then make a decision or make sure you ask all 4 questions... some of the car rides etc just seemed like endless filler. 


I could be wrong here but it seems more like the development went on for so long and the hype got so big that they turned around and got Keanu involved to maybe add some weight to the project (and as much as I love the guy) I wonder how much money was spent there that could have been used to better the game. 

I can only imagine that the people who have been fanboi no1 for this since it was first announced must be really frustrated over all this. 
I think get what they were trying to attempt but I think they might have focused so much on the shiny parts that they dropped the ball on the actual game part.

If I had to give it a star type rating I'd say a generous 3/5 because while it can look amazing... in this day and age there are too many companies big and small releasing content, products that fall far below the mark and where  the buyer is expected to pay up front but wait months if not years in order to use the product as it should be on release.",False
"I have 100% completed the game on 1.06 patch. 
I wouldn't recommend it in it's current state to anyone, this game needs another year of development at the least, there's a lot of missing features and broken mechanics. There's crafting recipes that give you more resources from disassembling them than crafting them, police system is a joke, civilians behaviour is a joke too, there is no driving AI and all cars just follow the set path, many skills are just completely useless/don't work/work not how they are described, there is weird 6th skill tree teaser that appears in some point in the story and it never gets unlocked or mentioned, and many many many other minor issues that accumulate together and make it big. Graphic settings feel like they were put last minute since there is barely any difference between ultra and low settings compared to most other games, hence why game performs so poorly for so many people.
Now to part not related to the game being unfinished, there is hundreds of different gigs and ncdp missions on the map which is just same thing as witcher 3 map questionmarks, don't expect anything interesting from them and doing them will just make you insanely overleveled and any enemy will become a joke. There are some interesting side quests but about half of them are very boring both story and gameplay wise, and overall there isn't that many side quests. I think world building and story is pretty good and i liked all the endings, but other than that rest of the game doesn't have much to offer as of now. And seeing their new roadmap and apology video doesn't bring me much confidence that game will get finished up properly. 
I don't know what happened with cdpr management since witcher 3, they are either being very dumb or purposefully malicious, i hope things will get better but hope is slim considering their previous actions.",False
"Sadly Unfinished, wait hald a year if you can. Still an amazing game though.",True
Very recommended. The story is amazing. Side quests are deep and play along with the main story in very good way. The RPG system is very deep and force you to choose what you want to play which is good RPG thing specially with implant system . There are a lot of glitches for sure but didn't ruin the overall experience for the game,True
"Grand Theft Auto 2077 is pretty damn good. It might be developed by a small Polish CD burning company instead of Rockstar and thus comes with a bunch of jank and much less refinement in its open world mechanics and AI design, but it also has better quest design and a bit of character customisation in turn. 

This game has myriad of big hits and some fairly glaring misses. Obviously expectations were sky high, and that has caused a lot of disappointment in varying departments, but CDPR has set up a crazy world with lots of opportunities of all kinds, colourful characters, powerful and varied factions, memorable locations and the list goes on. I'm just having a lot of fun exploring this world and its characters and stories. Even if it lacks the blast of innovation people might have been expecting, on top of the usual ""GTA"" stuff there's some crafting, augmenting, hacking, and enough other things that don't really feel impactful enough to be genre defining, but are present enough to make Cyberpunk stand out as something unique. 

Performance wise, it kind of runs like sewage on my somewhat aging system (medium/low settings, 45 fps, 980Ti, i5 8600K, 16GB RAM, SSD) but for me it's most certainly not the bug infested hive the reviews painted it to be. I've had one crash, one bike stuck in the asphalt and around 3 visual bugs, that's it. I'm looking forward to playing this again when i upgrade my system in the next months. Recommended!",True

"i really really really dont and never understand with this NPC and Vehicles texture loading mechanics ？？？？

you know some times , i dont think its really yours or mine hardwares problem .

【when you run on the street and play】i never see this slowly and strange texture loading in these games ：assassins creed unity ，syndicate，original , odyssey ，valhalla , red dead 2 , GTAV , the witcher 3 : wild hunt , Horizon Zero Dawn ，farcry 4 5 ，new dawn ，mafia 1 remake ，mafia 3 and the other sandbox games .

and the terrible thing is : if you run out over 5m , maybe 6m , then you will see these no texture NPC and vehicles will apper on your side suddenly or walk ，drive around on the street ，this is very horrible , this is future !!! its a good fps game !!! not a horrible movie ！！！！

this texture loading make me remember a game that i have played before : Wolfenstein the old blood , that games engine is ID TECH 5 , and give our players 32x Anti-Aliasing effect ，but even now , you cant play it with full 60 FPS in the ultra graphics setting , or maybe 30 fps , and that game with very terrible texture loading , if you look around : left right up down , you will see : wall ground weapons texture is loading before your eyes ，but that doesnt mean you and i have bad hardware , its games engine problem , so you can see they used new engine in wolfstein : the new colossus , well , i hope 2077 could fix texture problem .",False

"After playing a decent amount of this game. I have several things to say.

Even if the game is at best buggy and broken, its enjoyable to an extent. It really feels like Fallout 4 with vehicle mods.

The amount of content, the missed opportunities and the various short falls from what was advertised leaves an awful aftertaste. So much cut content, lost potential, flawed design choices and a barrage of disappointments.

You can buy BDs but never use them and only serve as a plot point in a few quests. The game itself overwhelms with you quests and sometimes it can be a bit difficult to track, with fixes offering jobs left and right. The phone itself is weird as you can receive calls mid conversation and have no way to cancel forcing to you listen to multiple conversations at the same time. The illusion of choice is apparent in most conversations. Bikes exist in the game yet no npc drives one. The non - existent AI is another disappointment too.

I wanted the game to be another GTA. Not in the gameplay sense, but in the standards it sets. The next gen open world game? BS this game lacks what even GTA 3 had. Properly working vehicle AI, how peds react to your actions, how driving around the city feels. And they even cut third person? FFS.

One minor gripe I also have is with the centered player marker on the minimap. Had they not even looked at GTA V once during development? It is quite important to have a non centered marker, especially when you are driving fast and need to see upcoming turns.

The game doesn't feel like an RPG either as it claims to be, differentiating it from GTA. You cant really define V and most of the prologue is lost as well. There are things the game implies you have done in the past but makes minimal effort to explain before hand as well.

At this point in time, the game feels way beyond unfinished, a gameplay demo, a shell of what could have been. The game feels like a mistake let free to the world way too early, and with the 1 month long delays.. and the game being in this state... what were they expecting? A miracle to happen that would magically fix whatever this is?

They should have taken a year long or greater delay from the get go, kept along with the ""Coming when its ready"" motto.

I guess the talent that brought them Witcher 3 took their bonuses and decided to call it quits. No wonder, the mess this game is in.

Another thing to note is how afraid the game itself is to portray some ideas. Afraid to show nipples in game adverts, player genitalia is limited to the inventory screen and the character creator almost as if it was a marketing gimmick, which I am definitely sure it was. And the 2 joytoys in the one location keeping night city alive. hah what a joke.

After all that however, the sound direction and writing of the game is wonderful and enjoyable. I really appreciate the writing of this game, even if it feels linear in most cases.",False
"This game could have used some more months in the oven.  There is gold in this game, and it is clear from the first minute you play it. 

However, the optimization is horrible.  At least, I hope. That means it might get fixed.  If not, CDPR outright lied to us with their elaborate system requirement spreadsheet.",False
"If it was made by a small indie low-budget studio I'd call this game a great success even with bugs and all. The story is good even if way too short. The actors did a phenomenal job. Absolutely loved the music and the city is beautiful. 
But. 
Where are all the meaningful choices that ""Ripple through the world""? Where are life paths that affect the main story? Where are the fully interactive NPC with day and night cycles?

And please, before you say that ""They were rushed"" keep in mind that they 8 years 131 million dollars for development. RDR2, The Witcher 3, GTA 5 were made in less time and on much smaller budgets. 

Even if they announced a year ago that they tried to give us all those things but it appeared to be harder than they thought and they still going to make a game but it's going to be an action-adventure and not that diverse. People would b*tch about it, sure, but we'd accept it. 
Instead, they quietly changed the genre from RPG to action-adventure and kept lying to us about meaningful choices and a fully interactive world ""Like you've never seen before"" till the very last day before the release.

And again in 2020, they insist on collecting tons of garbage inventory items, “helped” by an even worse UI than before. That UI is making me quit the game, each time I open it.

After completing the game im absolutely mindblown. The story is dense, well written and full of surprises. The game world is absolutely stunning. 
The only negative thing i have to say is, the moment you actively start doing side quests, the ""magic"" of the city gets a little bit lost. So for the first playthrough i highly recommend: stick to the main story line.

I think most other people were expecting something with more ""Freedom"", like the elderscrolls series.

"Cyberpunk 2077, beyond its bugs and performance issues, is fundamentally a poor game. It is a game having an identity crisis about whether it wants to be an RPG or an action adventure game and it drastically takes away from the experience. The game promised back in 2018 is nowhere to be found here, and it is an insult to the original developers to the Witcher 3 to even insinuate that his could come even close to it. The player is constantly railroaded into making decisions that at the end of the day don't matter, and ultimately won't have a real impact on the story, leading you to several ending options that will railroad you to the ending. The characters that are presented, while interesting, are a shadow of the personality and memorable dialogue that the Witcher provides you with, while also railroading your sexuality into one of two choices if you pick a male body/voice or a female. And that's arguably the most interesting part of the game. 

The open world that was delivered is a pale comparison to the open world of Witcher. While Witcher was a bigger world with little to do in it, it at the very least had activities to keep you occupied. 2077 gives its players a world that has no substance. It is a gorgeous city that clearly has attention to each and every detail, but there is practically nothing to do within the city. You are always doing missions, and each one will slowly glaze your eyes as you spend hour upon hour finding the next cyberpsycho that you will discuss with Regina for a minute before returning to doing gig after gig for hours to try and pad out your time or grind money. There is only a handful of actual side quests in the game, but dozens of gigs that have barely any interesting content. If I wanted to play a game, where I do quests for npcs that don't actually matter to the story or have any interesting moments within the game, and the quests are nothing but 'go to this location and steal x', or 'go this location and rescue x', I would play an MMO. And that's honestly how the game feels, like an MMO that doesn't have an online feature.

The systems as they exist within the game are a joke. The crafting system feels half implemented, as you can craft weapons or armor that the next minute, thanks to the poorly done loot system, could be useless. The hacking does feel well done, but there is little room for interesting use of it. The driving system feels floaty and doesn't feel as good as any other triple a game currently on the market. The cybernetics system feels so poorly used and feels as if it was worked on at last minute. It is immersion breaking, to see all these npcs that have fascinating and interesting cybernetics, only for me to be limited to hidden and vague passive power ups, or having to choose between a windows os hacking system or a mac os 10 second melee power boost. The map system doesn't accurately point out locations half the time, the gunplay is 5 years too late to the party to be interesting, the melee combat doesn't feel impactful or interesting.

The only saving grace is the main character, v's interactions with some of the more interesting characters and some of the more interesting quests that are on full display within the game. It is a game held up on the back of the interesting scenarios and characters that are there, as few as they are. V's relationship with Johnny Silverhand is interesting, but occasionally suffers from gameplay problems, where some quests present their relationship as a tentative friendship, while others present it as a common hatred. Silverhand himself, as a second protagonist, is interesting, as CDPR attempts to bring a character from the 2020 tabletop to the present while also making him feel like a real character, and that narrative is interesting, while Keanu Reeves does his best to play the character. The interesting scenarios they occasionally present are well done, some making me sick to my stomach and making me consider the groups that are presented in the world more, but that only sadly represents 1/9 of the quests that are offered. 

Cyberpunk 2077 was touted by CPDR in 2018 as the next generation of what it means to play an RPG, to have an immense open world while also having impactful stories and interesting characters. In 2020 we received an action adventure that was a generation late. It is a game made up of vast amounts of systems that all fall flat on their face, held up by a story that has its moments but has been done before. If the game somehow manages to fix all its technical problems, implement better AI, or finally optimize, you will still have a game that feels unfinished beyond a shadow of a doubt. If you want to play a RPG that features a million boring systems, uninteresting quests, combat that will make you glaze your eyes over from a company that has put out amazing games before, World of Warcraft is right there.

I hope, at least, that the upper management of CPDR is fired for its treatment of its staff, and becoming the corporation that they have the gall to hypocritically portray in a negative light.",False
"EDIT: Finished the Game with around 90% overall completion.

Yes there are bugs. I had to reaload a previous autosave around 5 times over the 57 hours. Yes, the graphics glitch. Yes, it is not finished. Some mechanics are clearly missing, the AI is not good, police system sucks, driving and fistfights suck too.

But damn, these 60 hours just flew by so fast. The environment, the graphics, the characters and story. It is even better than Witcher 3 and I think W3 is the best game ever made. No other game in recent years has felt so good to just spend hours in. I honestly think that with 1-2 years more of developement, this coould've been the best game of our lifetime.

"Another amazing CDPR game marred by bugs and glitches at launch. It is an absolutely amazing game regardless of the issues surrounding it.

[b] Performance and Bugs [/b]

Ok lets get this out of the way first. Have had hardly any major bugs or glitches in my 80+ hr playtime but YMMV. Had a couple of quest breaking bugs (doors not opening, npcs blocking the door) but were solved with a simple quicksave and reload. Was able to complete every quest in the game so complaints there. I might just be super lucky or maybe I'm just not actively trying to find glitches but I've seen very few. The majority of visual glitches I saw were after the last 1.06 patch so they might have borked something there. Nothing major, mostly some pop-ins while driving fast, vehicles spawning half in the ground, a couple of T-poses as well.

Yes the AI is non-existent, you probably already knew that by now. Does it effect my enjoyments of the game? Nope. Cops are not involved with the story and hardly have anything to do with the side gigs. They could take out the cops from this game it wouldn't change a thing. If not having a good cop and driving AI is a deal breaker for you, dont get this game. It will not cure your GTA itch at all. In my opinion most people would be too busy with all the other stuff you can do in this game to be bothered by this. Think of it as the Witcher in Cyberpunk setting.

Mid-high tier hardware is probably a requirement for enjoyment of this game. This game certainly needs some hefty patches but it is still playable, and more importantly, enjoyable in it's current state.

I would definitely recommend waiting a few months if you can to play it.

I play on a gaming laptop and I can maintain decent frame rates in most areas with RTX on. Some of the denser areas in the city do suffer from frame drops but this can be ironed out in patches. RTX off and DLSS on in steady 60+ fps for me but RTX makes the game so much better.
Loads times are truly impressive with an SSD. I clocked it at 8 secs from main menu to in-game.

[b] Visuals [/b]

Absolutely stunning graphics if you have the hardware for it. The city design, character models, vehicles and just the general ambiance in this game is breathtaking. I initially turned off ray tracing because it tanked my fps but its like a whole different game with RTX on. After patch 1.05 I was able to maintain decent fps with RTX on at medium with DLSS set to quality. If possible play with RTX, highly recommended! Its still visually impressive with RTX off though.

[b] Sound and Music: [/b]

One of the things that makes or breaks a game for me is music. And this game delivers in that aspect superbly. P. T. Adamczyk and Marcin Przybyłowicz along with the ensemble of artists deserve all the praise. The radio stations have a wide variety genres ranging from pop, rock, synthwave, electronic, punk, and metal. Absolutely love the score in this game, just wish it was more frequent.
The sound design of the game is also amazing. Guns and cars sound good, ambient sounds are also decent.
The dialogue had some issues where it would overlap or appear to be coming from a distance. Again nothing too bad just random inconsistencies.

The voice acting is top notch. I highly recommend Female V. Her VA does a far better job at delivering lines than Male V, trust me on this. Keanu felt a bit off at the start but towards the end you really get an outstanding performance by him. He just doesnt play the angry douchebag rocker that well.

[b] Quests: [/b]

In classic CDPR fashion, the quest design is again one of the best I've seen recently. The Witcher had a very slow start which put off a lot of people. This game is much better at pacing. However, similar to the Witcher 3, it gets pretty rushed towards the ending.
Several different playstyles are viable to complete quests but you do have to plan out your builds in advance. You cant max out every skill tree by the end of the game so just take note of that.
There are essentially 4 different types of quests. Main quests, major side quests, minor side quests, filler side quests/activities. The main quests and major side quests (Panam, Judy, Johnny) are all fleshed out pretty well. The minor side quests are a hit or miss. You can find some hidden gems like Sinnerman, or they can just be quests that ask you to take out a target or steal some stuff. The game does not do a good job of distinguishing them but I highly recommend just taking your time with the game and doing as much as possible. Then there's the filler stuff like ncpd scanner hustles which are pretty boring and just there for you to level up and farm stuff. These are entirely skippable.

[b] Skill, perks and combat: [/b]

I feel like the more you play the better it gets in terms of gameplay (who would have thought). Initially the enemies are hard to kill and you pretty much have nothing but shitty guns. As you level up you get some really good upgrades that are worth investing some time into. Get the double jump from a ripperdoc as soon as you can, it opens up a lot of possibilities in gameplay. Towards the end you'll be one-shotting people quite easily. If you delve into the perks, weapon mods/attachments, and cyberware upgrades, then the game will be quite easy for you from the start. You can go a multitude of builds like Mantis blades melee build, stealthy netrunner build, or the absolutely bonkers handgun build. I was one-shotting gonks through walls with my revolver ez. I feel like this games first 2 difficulties are made for games journalists so even gonks like them can finish it.

[b] Customization: [/b]

Not gonna lie, was very let down in the start with the way customization is handled in this game. Stats are tied to your clothing and that forces you to equip whatever has the highest stat regardless of how it looks. But during the later stages it really doesnt matter as you are kind of OP at that point so wear what you want. A cyberware mod gives you 200 armor, body skill tree have lots of perks that give armor/resistance etc. Besides, you hardly get to see your character at all which is a shame cause I would have liked them to at least have 3rd person cutscenes.
There's no car customization at all. Found some really cool cars used by npc's (I'm a sucker for neon lights) but you cant keep them, only the ones you buy are available to you.
You get some stuff during the story that you can display in your apartment but thats about it. Don't really care that much about it as you dont visit your apartment frequently. Maybe in future dlcs they can add some content there.

[b] General: [/b]

This game has some serious futuristic vibes and references to other pop culture. Sandstorms in badlands: Bladerunner vibes. Peralez quest: Black mirror-esque. Delamain quest: Mass effect endings. Tons and tons of easter eggs like John Wick, Matrix, Portal, San Andreas, The Office... I could go on and on. Quite fun finding all these in the game.

[b] The ending (no spoilers): [/b]

Man the endings in this game are depressing af. I can appreciate the writers for such emotionally charged stories that truly resonate with you but come on man.. give us [i]one[/i] slightly hopeful ending maybe? I really hope there is a DLC where there is a possibility of a happy ending. Whatever the case, Cyberpunk truly delivers in the story aspect (imo). The Sun, The Star, and the secret ending are all good but the best imo is the Star ending.

This game does not do any particular aspect better than other games but it combines several good ones to deliver a good game. The same could be said of the Witcher 3 (which is my highest rated game) but people tend to forget that in their outrage. I hope people give this game a chance and when its patched 6 months down the road, I am confident it will be regarded as a truly remarkable game.

If I had to give a score I would rate it 8.5/10 in its current state but I can see the potential for 9 or 9.5/10 with patches and DLCs.",True
"I can't see any reason that justifies Cyberpunk 2077 being open-world rather than linear. There is a very good game at the heart of Cyberpunk but it is buried under a deluge of padding, poor AI, an archaic loot system, and bugs.
You start the game by customising your character and choosing a lifepath. Appearance and gender affect your romance options while the lifepath gives you one of 3 introductions along with differing dialogue options down the line.

Once the intro is over, the 3 lifepath stories coalesce into an engaging story about a MacGuffin biochip, weaving in and out of the major Cyberpunk themes. As a fan of the genre, I found the main story and most of the side quests to be fascinating and the most engaging parts of the game. Unfortunately, there are a lot of peripheral objectives and activities surrounding the quality missions that weigh down the experience as a whole.

The map is plastered with icons that represent activities of varying quality. Unfortunately, most will see you going to a location and killing some people with little context beyond ""they are bad guys"". These activities will be framed by soulless phone calls and end with money and exp materialising in your pocket. It is blatant padding, present to give the illusion that Night City is a place where stuff happens, while in reality there isn't much going on at all. At a glance, the city is gorgeous, sporting all of the neon and mismatched architecture a Cyberpunk city should have. Yet the inhabitants of Night City are mostly mindless drones. Seriously, the AI of pedestrians and drivers is Driver 3 levels of basic. Pedestrians have a stock crouch animation when things get violent and there seems to be no variation in their responses to your actions. The most glaring routines are those of the children. They wander around, unaccompanied, doing nothing. In the Witcher 3, kids would play tag, kick around in the mud and gawp at Geralt's swords. Why are these kids now so emotionless and why are they all missing their guardians?

Things only get worse when you start driving. The only response other drivers ever have is to stop their vehicles and beep the horn. Park your car slightly off the curb? Cars will stop (even when there's space to go around) and beep their horn. Crash into a van at 120mph, they will stop and beep their horn. Shoot at them.. they don't really do anything when you do that actually but you get the idea. I am not a huge GTA fan but I have to admit, Rockstar nails pedestrian AI. Seeing the various reactions of crowds is one of the many joys an open-world city can provide. Without it the world feels so superficial.

This feeling extends to the available cars too. Cars cannot be customised and are pretty much just a cosmetic option. Yes, they have differing speeds but the layout of Night City does not lend itself to fast driving and the car controls are average at best. This wouldn't bother me too much, but flying cars are present throughout the game, so it's pretty galling that you never get your hands on one or customise an existing car to fly.

As an RPG there is also an in depth levelling system. There are over a dozen perk trees to fill out with the general buffs and upgrades you would expect, like increase health or do more damage. You can also buy upgrades like a rocket launcher in your wrist which is very cool, or a quickhack that sets enemies on fire. It is a typical RPG character progression system, it works well but it's not groundbreaking and the UI needs some work. Aside from character progression there is also loot which is handled very poorly. The game drowns you in weapons and clothing but most of it is useless. Throughout the game I have encountered about 6 guns that I actually use, these are ""iconic"" guns that can be upgraded. Despite this, almost every mission will end with my inventory being stuffed with a dozen new (weaker) assault rifles and pistols. The constant routine of running back and forth to a vendor is exhausting and the kind of thing we all had enough of in Skyrim, almost a decade ago. Similarly, you will frequently discover an entire new wardrobe. There are lots of cool clothing items in Cyberpunk but each of them has an arbitrary armour number so you will spend the majority of the game wearing a stupid mismatched outfit to maximise your armour.

The gameplay itself is very basic FPS-RPG action. Bullet sponge enemies are frequent and your options are usually just stealth or kill everything. I enjoyed it, but the AI is simple and quickhacks are never as impactful as Geralt's Signs were.

If you like the genre of Cyberpunk and have a system that can run it, you will love this game. If you are looking for the new benchmark for Open-Worlds you will be sorely dissappointed. I can't wait to see what CD Projekt red improves over the next year but as is, the open-world element of this game has glaring flaws that we have seen in dozens of lower budget games before it.",True
nice,True
"Edit: Hours are low because I used a modified executable to bypass the Red Launcher. However, I did not realize until later that this also bypassed Steam. And if the game does not run through Steam, you can not get achievements. I played about 4 hours so far.

Expected at least a half rpg, but that is not what this game delivers. No matter which ""backstory"" you choose it makes absolutely no difference after about 10 minutes. The game throws characters at you that V knows, but you, the player, have no information about, and you're expected care about them. The dialogue is impressively uninteresting and unengaging; you can attempt to listen, but have no idea what anyone is talking about.

There is absolutely nothing to roleplay. You play as V, a generic tough guy/girl mercenary. You can equip clothes you'll to look at, as the game is locked to first person view. Dialogue options are not options at, but rather give you flavor text until you have one ""option"" left to choose. You are part some organization somehow with no explanation and they give you missions. Markers for these missions constantly float around as a dynamic HUD and block your view from the game world.

The NPCs are the least life-like or reactive I've seen since GTA3. Night City does not feel alive in the slightest. Nothing about the gameplay feels satisfying. Mouse control feels smoothed over, shooting feels bland, enemies are bullet sponges, driving feels awkward. The game's soundtrack and radio stations are awful. And worst of all, for an open world, the game feels extremely linear. You don't get to choose anything or be anybody, you are just V.

I have not had crashing issues, however performance is very poor even at the lowest settings. You need much more than a decent computer to run this game properly. This all makes for a very unpleasant overall experience. This game is boring.

We were not promised the greatest game of all time, but we certainly were not promised the worst, yet here we are.",False

"Game is solid, despite the bugs and crashes. My experience on PS5 was prettier, but more unstable. Here it's considerably more stable, but more visual bugs. If you're worried about immersion, waiting is fine. 

Overall I'm extremely satisfied with the game, so much so that I'm on my second run. The game is lush and full of intrigue and phenomenal stories and characters. Considering as of writing, its a bit criminal that only 11.9% of players have finished the prologue.

The game will get more polished, but its good now. Enjoy.",True
"Believe me or not - for over 30 hours I havent encountered any bug in this game. There were some minor glitches, but hey, this game is so awesome, you will regret not playing it right away. As for the Witcher 3, devs already announced first free DLCs and some major DLCs are coming too - thats always nice to hear in advance. Collectors edition was so great and merch inside was of so awesome quality, I havent seen for some time.

All in all this game is a great stepping stone in the new age of gaming, GOTY 100% and super experience for any player. Totally recommend!",True
IF you were not over hyped for the game then its really great.,True
"Night City.  I bought this game to immerse into a cyberpunk themed escapist fantasy.  The gameplay is very similar to GTA games, but with better storytelling and slightly better combat.    

Night City.  The level of expansiveness and detail is at once incredible and slightly disappointing.  There is variance and interactivity in the environment, but also noticeable amounts of repetition and passivity. 

The leveling and perk system is almost entirely geared toward combat.  I was hoping to have more social options.  FPS combat makes me motion sick, so I have my son complete those parts.  He plays a lot of FPS and thinks the combat is decent but not as good as the top tier FPS games.

The game really opens up after Act 1.  I suggest powering through the first act and Night City will open up to you.  

Overall, a wonderful game that conveys all the gritty neon-drenched noir that is cyberpunk.",True

Just dont get in your head what people saying, it have problem yes, but really minor ones, nothing they wont or dont want to fix.

"33 hours in, Cyberpunk 2077 is one the most undercooked, underwhelming and disappointing releases of 2020 hell even in the past 3 years of the industry. Its a good game being buried with very flawed fundamental and technical aspects. CDPR just ran out of time and excuses, promising too much and being pressured by their shareholders, the games media and their insufferable fanbase.

Ratings:

Graphics 8.5/10
 
On higher-end hardware with Raytracing and all the bells and whistles mostly turned on, its no doubt a treat to look at. Cities are rendered with luscious futuristic details and post processing effects. The artstyle and design direction is really good. Its the best looking Cyberpunk game to date. 

Gameplay 5/10
One of its underwhelming aspects, the rpg elements is good but not up to par with what CDPR had promised and what CDPR had achieved in the past in Witcher 3. The hacking mechanics is a welcomed mechanic but is simply too shallow to be consistently used as an option. The weapons are really nice to use, it has weight to it  but lacks properly balanced stats or unique attributes to warrant it as a great RPG element. The stealth mechanics is poorly implemented. 

Performance and Technicals 3/10
Riddled with bugs(even game breaking ones; although I havent stumbled across any game breaking ones during my 33 hour playthrough, i really hope i dont get one.) The game always has this vibe that it is going to break any minute now. I have encountered mission bugs where i have to save/reload to get an npc to follow or spawn at the objective. Missions where i get stuck in places where i had overly buffed myself with items. NPC's T-posing and spawning randomly out of nowhere. Optimization is very lackluster  as well, people have been struggling to run the game properly when they are boasting of having hardware such as a RTX 3080. A.I is a joke especially the spawning police a.is.

Story: 7/10
It is a good story, but nothing groundbreaking. Its interesting enough to hold your attention. Side missions are used to develop and flesh out characters. The voice-acting is also decent as well.

Content: 6.8/10
Theres decent amount of content running to be done here, from wide ranging amount of side quests. To gigs you can do to earn rewards, it feels like a modern Far Cry game where you go to a quest marker, clear the objective, rinse and repeat rather than a full fledge RPG, but it doesnt mean its entirely bad. Its surprisingly well though out. But again, the content that has been cut out from the game seriously demerits it. We were promised much more from more customization options, more unique mechanics and etc.

Overall: 30.3/50

0-10 Dont touch
10-20 Bad Game
20-30 Average
30-40 Very Good
40-50 Must Play

Cyberpunk 2077 for now, is an average game marred by technical problems and broken promises. The games media touted this as the upcoming game that will revolutionise the gaming industry and be one of the most groundbreaking games of the decade. They are wrong. I did not find any signs of what they have described in the game. If it is working correctly, it is a good time to play through but doesnt come even an inch to being something ground-breaking or revolutionary. It is best to wait for about another year, where CDPR has heavily patch it to fix its technical issues and added in more content that was promised. Hold on to your money, for now.",False

"A lot of people who say this is overhyped clearly doesn't know anything about the game. This is by far, the best game I had EVER played! It's THAT good in every single way. Graphical wise, gameplay wise, AND story wise. There are a lot of bugs at the time of me writing this, but just like the Witcher 3, it will be addressed. Some complaining regarding poor optimization yet they fail to understand that this game was built for High End Gaming. Can't wait to play more of it!",True
"After spending almost 100 hours in the game and completing the main storyline I finally feel like I can give a proper verdict.

Night City sets new standards for open worlds and immersive story telling. Even after so many hours I feel I barely scratched the surface of the amount of content there is here and of everything this world has to offer. It is a game with a captivating story that isn’t afraid to shock and disturb you, often times rivaling and surpassing the Witcher 3´s best quests (not to mention the amazing cast of characters you will meet in your journey). It was never going to live up to all the ungodly expectations but I can say I am more than satisfied with what has been delivered here.

That being said, this is also a game full of glaring issues and a lot of missed opportunities; some questionable design decisions and features that simply feel half done. It clearly needed more time and even though I think the good outweighs the bad there are instances where cuts and missing content can be noticed (hopefully DLC and expansions will add at least some of the missing stuff). As for the bugs, I was one of the lucky ones managing to avoid crashes completely and just having visual glitches here and there with reloading always fixing it. However, the game looks to be extremely broken for some other people so keep that in mind; it is something they definitely need to address although the recent hotfixes have corrected a lot of issues. Regardless, Cyberpunk is still extremely demanding and will be a challenge to run at 60fps or above if you don’t have a high-end rig. Keep that in mind as well depending on your hardware. 

Despite all that, I still think this is a brilliant game full of potential and incredible moments which I am sure will only get better with time. I have nothing but praise and good wishes for the CDPR team for what they have created and hope it will live up to its full potential soon.",True
Literally can spit in my own @$$,True
"20 hours in, and it's looking like that's not going to slow down any time soon. My experience is on the Very Hard setting.

The game launched with a bunch of bugs, none of them have been game breaking for me and I feel for those that did have them. However the immersion is huge in this game. I love that I can attack every mission and area in multiple different ways and if you aren't careful you're punished for it. The AI is funny sometimes, but they use cover, they flush you out of cover with grenades and if possible will try to flank you, especially if they're melee so you have to play around that.

The story so far (10-12% in) has been engaging and fun, the characters are all fleshed out and banter with each other, so far I've hit three ""Choices"" that I feel will have a big impact later on, and I'm excited to see how that leads me. I've seen complaints about the origin aspect not taking more form, I like how it is, I chose it to get into the headspace of my character and play the way their origin would lead you to believe I would.

The graphics are stunning, even on my dated 1080/7700k rig from several years ago, the loading times are fast considering the sheer amount of geometry it's pumping out. I'm getting a stable 55-60fps on a mix of High/Ultra and a couple Meidum, and while I'm greedy and want more, I expected about that or less on my rig.

The gameplay is actually fairly tight, melee hits how you would expect, it's not jank like Skyrim or other open world fps games, the gunplay feels good to a point (I have auto aim off completely), the recoil can be annoying to deal with for sure. The good part is the guns FEEL good, they sound good, they pack a punch and you know it. Personal favorite is the railgun sniper that goes through walls.

Overall, if you can look past minor bugs and some optimization issues which I believe *will* be fixed, this is a great game and a great setting to get lost in for a few weeks. Highly recommended",True

"Game is riddled with bugs and glitches that are immersion breaking, game is definitely need more development time and isn't ready to be released yet.

"This game is not as bad as some may say. Definitely a pick up when it goes on sale (given the current state of the game). I would expect some kind of big patch or DLC to fill in the gaps later from the developer. I am not entirely thrilled that essentially we are getting an early access version of a potentially great title at full price.

* * *

Some observations:

- The main story is good. IMO the right way to play the story is to progress side missions concurrently. If you only play the main story missions then you might have a very hard time (as your V will not have levelled up enough or acquired the right kind of gear). Side missions are not always visible - some need to be found by roaming the world - some others pop up at a specific time of day - and yet some others only show up when V has enough street cred.

- The main characters are excellent and I would be receptive to more characters being introduced into the game.

- Compared to story characters, non-core NPCs lack depth. Hell. Even in Hitman, random people complement 47's tie/suit depending on which suit he is wearing. I could have V run around naked and the only thing these NPCs say would be ""F off mind your own business"". (!)

- Sound design and audio mixing is extremely good. Music is very good as well (though combat music is a bit repetitive). However, the preferred radio channel I have selected when riding any specific vehicle is not remembered across rides (!) and sometimes the first/third person camera preference is not remembered either (!!).

- There seems to be quite a bit of cut content which I expect will be unveiled once CDPR unwinds this mess. Prologue needs meat. Our fellow gamers want it.

- I did not like having to micromanage inventory. Why should V run any slower when she picks up 20 weapons?! Give us a magic pocket with infinite inventory! Every mission ends with V selling random items and guns and I have to call V's car over just to stuff its trunk with more higher-tier gear. My late game V now has several hundred thousands of Eurodollars and she could bleed vendors dry after big jobs (as the game would refuse to liquidate any more items when the vendor runs out of money!)

- Keybindings are kind of screwed up. For example, on PC the F key is hardwired and to change that you must edit the underlying configuration file. However, you could change all key bindings this way, and they stay changed.

- Stealth mechanics need work. Enemies can spot you in no time and the sight line does not seem to have proper range cutoff. There was a mission (side job) where the facility to be infiltrated had holes in its walls. Enemies can spot you straight away. No timer etc like how HITMAN does it. Further, combat state (i.e. hunted or not) mechanics need work. For example, being near an armed mine seems to trigger enemy soundbites but not combat status.

- Dropping NPC bodies might kill them (!) but this is not deterministic (!!). Seems to depend on what is on the ground. Ideally this should be deterministic - dropping an NPC should not kill the NPC.

- Save mechanics need work. Say you put V behind cover, away from an enemy, save and load that save immediately. The enemy could move, and spot V as the save is loaded (!!!) and you will hear the excellent warning sound before the game is fully loaded (!!!) - then you enter into combat immediately upon resumption.

- Dumping an unconscious NPC into a freezer kills the NPC immediately (eh). Also, if you leave a body leaning against a freezer (because you did not want to kill the NPC), then save and reload the save immediately, the body might slide to the ground upon reload AND that impact might kill the NPC (!!!) but it does not always happen (!!!) - if the freezer is in another room, the body only starts sliding down to the ground as you open the door (!!!)

- Countless times after completing a mission, V gets hit by an NPC speeding away in his/her vehicle. Something is seriously wrong with pathfinding and navigation. No respect.

- Weapons rewarded as a result of completing jobs are tied to V's level at the time of completion. This results in ridiculously skewed stats such as an early game Epic level item having worse stats than a mid or late game Common item.

- Vehicles steer strangely. I did not like how any car moves and steers in the game. The motorcycle is ok.

- Fistfights are a bit annoying, seems to have hit registration issues.

- Melee (swords etc) is ok. Hit registration is ok. Range is a bit short but in general ok.

- Guns are ok. I only like the pistols and sniper rifles. Other types of guns feel unwieldy or are too slow for my play style. Sniper rifles do not zoom, apparently, which is a bit annoying.

- Grab (i.e. Subdue in Hitman) is ok, however I did not like that Grab will fail on enemies with higher body levels yet there is no way to find out until V is close. V can scan enemies for data already including what attacks are effective/ineffective. But the chance to successfully Grab is not shown.

- Quickhacking sucked with the starter Cyberdeck. It is very good with the Epic level Cyberdeck, though. However the targeting mechanics needs work as sometimes there is a literal single pixel which must be aimed at to acquire the target (since both quickhack selection and zooming are bound to the mouse wheel, zooming is not always possible). N.B. There is a side mission which gives you several Epic quickhacks (if you are playing the corpo path).

- Braindance Editor UI is very buggy.",True

"Крч, мнение по киберпанку 2077 после прохождения на все доступные мне концовки и 77 часов в стиме:
От игры ждали, что она будет 12/10, а она оказалась всего лишь 10/10
Геймплейно киберпанк - восхитительная шутер-рпг в открытом мире. В ней есть совершенно все что нужно на любой вкус: крутая стрельба и ближний бой, многогранная прокачка персоанажа. Она подстраивается под любой плейстайл и позволяет проходить себя так, как игроку будет угодно. Так же и игроку она может предоставить тот геймплей, который ему нужен. Кому-то - рельсовый сюжетный экшен, бодро повествующий цельную историю. Кому-то - разветвленную систему разнообразных интересных побочных квестов. Кому-то - огромный и наполненный событиями мир для исследования, в котором можно долго и неспешно (или спешно) залипать долгими часами.
Сюжетно киберпанк - очень цельное и глубокое произведение. Под конец начинаешь со страшной силой сопереживать и Джонни, и Ви, и остальным важным сюжетным персонажам. И, если завязка сюжета может быть немного неловкая, то концовки просто невероятные и разрывающие.
ДАЛЬШЕ СПОЙЛЕРЫ ПЕПЕГА
В общем позитивных концовок нет, в любом случае либо Ви расстается с телом в пользу Джонни, либо сама остается в умирающем теле, либо же и вовсе становится цифровой копией до лучших времен. И все эти концовки логичное и красивое завершение сюжета, без обязательств со стороны разработчиков продолжать историю этих персонажей, что логично и правильно. Сюжет цельный и завершенный. Ведь вселенная вертится не вокруг одного персонажа, как ведьмак вокруг геральта. Ви по сути ноунейм, а Джонни - уже живая (мертвая) легенда. Еще одна очень сильная концовка - самоубийство Ви, где заложен мощнейший посыл от сдпр про то, что не стоит заканчивать жизнь самоубийством, за что сдпроджектам отдельный респект, и если эта концовка помешает хотя бы паре человек принять решение о суициде - выпуск игры уже стоил того.
К большому своему сожалению я не смог получить секретную концовку, но это НУ ОЧЕНЬ СИЛЬНО мотивирует перепроходить. А реиграбельность в играх это тоже очень круто. Киберпанк стал для меня одной из немногих игр, после прохождения которых ты еще продолжаешь размышлять и переворачивать игру у себя в мозгах. Такое у меня редко случается, но такие фильмы и игры запоминаются надолго.
В общем киберпанк 10/10, совершенно не жалею что купил и поиграл, сдпроджектам мое уважение, надеюсь у них все будет в порядке и жду следующих игр от них",True
"While the shooting mechanics are pretty ok, the driving is average and the bugs are quite frequent, CD Project Red has made a fantastic immersive RPG that knows what it is and what it isnt. Absolutely magnificent game that has pulled me in like no other. I already know I will spend hours with this.",True
"It feels wrong to review this, because to be quite honest this feels like it needed 2-3 years longer in the oven. I have no relationship with this company, I'm indifferent to them. I'm not a hater nor a fan boy. 

I'm going to be honest, I don't like the combat. I predominantly play RPGs but I enjoy shooter mechanics too, albeit I'm not good at it. But in this game, shooting is very, very unsatisfying. The entire RPG element of leveling up and putting points into skills really do not translate well into a shooter. Actually, it removed the entire enjoyment of shooters. When I headshot someone, I expect them to die, and you are rewarded with that satisfaction of delivering it. I don't want to see DPS numbers like I'm playing a MMO. The entire experience would have been much better without this, guns are guns, customisation is great, but at some point it's like you have to take a step back and think about what works great and what doesn't. You can have a lot of ways to work with guns without trying to force a bizzare rpg skill tree element to it.

The controls are really frustrating, the universal button for interactions and such in fps games is E. For some reasons, they decided no, we aren't having that. On top of this, you can't customise this without taking the time to edit your configuration files. Great. Nobody likes over complicating simple things, but in this game, that's a feature. There are so many buttons, for so many things during so many different settings, it's a headache! 

Of course the optimization is pretty bad. A LOT of settings are hidden, and relies on on people to mod it to reveal them. Why? Honestly? What is the point of making a game if you don't intend to make it accessible? Is it really so much to ask to have options for bad stuff only console users need? I don't need to have temporal AA because I am not going to play this game in 30fps where I want go hide ugly stuff. Sometimes it feels like developers are so focused and obsessed with making the next big graphical looks to their games they forget they are making a game all together.

Character customisation is strange, you can only really make gorgeous characters in some way or another. Actually I wonder if it was just a joke, because it's so limiting in many ways. I get like how they are trying to be so edgy with their genitals and nipples, but this is not new. Other games have this too, it's like it overshadowed everything else. All I really wanted to do was make a character like looks like myself, but the creator is like in BDO, it has a theme, and you are limited within it, so you can only make Chad jawline supermodels. What's the fun in that?",False
"[h1] Disclaimer [/h1] 
I know, the game has issues, both technical and design. I also know how the game is unplayable on consoles, but I had played on PC. It is all irrelevant because of how it felt to play the game. Do you enjoy listening to bad music? I sometimes do. It's more or less the same.


[h1] My impressions [/h1] 
I absolutely enjoyed my time in Night City. The game looks astonishing on my 1060/6GB, albiet with low 30 to 40 FPS after tweaking. But the graphics is not something we are here for, right?

I was in for the story and world. Main story is quite thrilling, but overall it's just okay. It's not interactive enough. The CDPR pulled Mass Effect 3 all over my face with the main story. 
[spoiler] The only things that matter in terms of ending is whether you did the Panam sideline and you attitide towards Johnny Silverhand during his quests. Both open an option for ending, the Panam one is, imo the best ending there is, and the Johnny one is tough to get and I have no idea how to do it. Might try to get it in my re-plays. You just get 3 choices in the end. Do you want to choose an easy way out? Do you want to trust Arasaka? Do you want to go there and get what you need by force? Then, if you do, do you do it with the Aldecaldos, who are willing to help, or alone (secret ending), or you let Johnny to take over and score his 50 year old revenge? What do you do with the chip? Become an AI or take your body back to die in half a year? I really expected that whole other sidequests would allow me to get more help or options for the ending. Maybe Peralez would be willing to help you somehow? Maybe Judy would assist you? River? No. No such things. [/spoiler] This was really frustrating to see. I wanted the mainstory to reach New Vegas level. It did not happen.

Then, sidequests. These are beyond awesome. Small stories, large sidelines, both are good quality and are really emotional. Loved all of them. Except for Johnny's. Not because of the quests per se, just because he's a self-righteous jackass.

The city. It's huge. It's detailed. It's gorgeous. It's non-interactive, which is not a big deal for me. Nothing much more to say. It has tons of activities. It's just a an awesome decoration for stories. Not the story itself.

Now, the RPG system and combat. Some people say that RPG system is useless. I say it's horribly imbalanced. (Yes, I've played on normal, should've picked hard.) Whatever spec you're aiming for, starting at level ten, your characters becomes a death machine. In my playthrough, I was just able to see and oneshot all enemies through the walls. My friend went melee bulild and zipped through enemies slicing them up with ease. At certain point the fights just cease being thrilling, the challenge disappears. Probably the games needs an option to respec your V.

Crafting and loot. Crafting makes game easier, albiet a bit grindy. Loot? It's some Diablo-tier stuff. You get tons of loot, while 90% of it is just garbage you instantly disassemble for materials.

What do I say about the game? It is flawed mess. But it's a lovable mess, for me at least. For a long time I haven't felt such joy from a singleplayer game.
7/10, nothing that can't be fixed by mods or patches. Maybe except for the story.",True
My dream world.,True
"What a game! Despite all the criticism that the release was accompanied by, I can totally recommend this game. In some short aspects, let me try to sum up:

PROS
==============

+ Graphics AAA, amazingly detailed world, characters and models
+ Story is fantastic and immersive. On many occasions I got goosebumps due to the wonderful narration and the bitter-sweet moments
+ Details: basically everything you see, hear and touch in that game, has its place in lore and world. Even the most far out graffiti at a dumpster has a connection to the world. The radio and TV shows are so genuinely created, everything in that world, IS actually a part of it. It feels connective, immersive and not artificially created. 
+ Open-World: the detailed and very lovely handcrafted world invites to explore, but also fills up this city with lore, story and many many characters. Diverse characters, factions and places. As all is created to fit 100% into this lore, the world feels not empty beneath the surface, like many other open-world games do.
+ Sound & Music: just as immersive and perfectly adapted to the style of the world
+ Gameplay: though not reinventing the genre, the mechanisms work. The shooter parts are straight, the stealth parts are fun, and the hacking possibilites are very diverse. So, whatever you play, the style works. Some approach may be more prudent at certain times, but every solution somehow leads to the quest'e end.
+ Johnny Silverhand: probably the best driven dialogues between him and the main character V. From totally hating this man to really want to hug him. He triggers EVERY emotion. What an act!!!
+ Skills: diverse as the world. Many combinations, MANY!
+ Items and lore: just more than you probably could buy in a whole WalMart. So many items and gear. Phew.

- glitches, some bugs and crashes (as in many other games at release), so far no stoppers for me. Just some minor things that usually result in some funny things in the world (like jumping cars, or strange character anomations)
- driving: basically every car feels a bit different, but most of them feel like driving a damn freighter. Some patches should cater to that later.
- world-filler content: yeah, some quests feel a bit world-filling, but as I mentioned, this leads to acutally a better immersion, as EVERY quest (as small as it is) contributes to the world. And be it only a chat protocol from some netrunner. It connects to the game. Rarely seen games that have done different.

I totally understand console players, when getting angry, but from a PC player's POV, this game is fine, a bit edgy still, but on a great way. Mainly due to the most detailed world I ever encountered. What I want to emphasize is, that this game's world does not lack substance under the surface, like many other open world games. This game is a world in itself. Every aspect in that game, every detail contributes to this world. If you decide to look for it.

Spare me the hate. This game may have its flaws. But it redefines the genre in many aspects. Especially in richness and immersion, character driven narrative, detailed lore and a main charatcter and story, that are not exchangeable. 

Compared to the yearly UbiSoft reskins, I prefer this game over 10 other open-world games, combined.

Still looking for a chick with 3 tits,True
"I am not going into the technical aspects of the game, like bugs or glitches, because I'm sure those will be ironed out as time goes by. Witcher 3 had similar problems and became a very polished and overall great game later on. Get ready for yet another 'Enhanced Edition' - a recurring thing with CDPR it seems at this point.

Gunplay is fine for me btw.

What annoys me in Cyberpunk 2077 first and foremost is the fact that this plays almost exactly like ANY OTHER open world game. The cyberpunk setting is absolutely brillant (being one of my favorite genres period). Problem is, the overall game design and the so-called gameplay loop feels like I'm playing Assassin's Creed, Watch Dogs or Saint's Row. There's so much busy work here, it's ridiculous. And all those mini quests are so repetitive, that they take away from the bigger and better side quests. Less would've been more here for sure. I wanted to clear out the whole Watson district before moving on in the main storyline, but I couldn't do it - it bored me to the moon and back after a while. Witcher 3 had some of this as well, but I find it to be much more tedious here.

Then there are the minor annoyances, that really bug me:

- One side quest is a boxing tournament... again. Come on, you would think that in a cyberpunk setting, they would and could come up with something new that fits the new theme.

- Another side quest is buying cars. Literally dozens of cars, with every car being a separate quest. Why? In Mafia II, you could just steal a car and bring it to your mechanic friend to 'legalize' it for you - no need for making this extra quests...

- The attributes/perks are organized in a weird way. For example: firearm skills are to some degree under different skill trees, not the same. The shotgun skill is linked to an attribute that doesn't really make sense for it to be there. Some skills are even totally useless alltogether.

- The level system is bloated. In addition to attributes and perks, which level up separately, there's also the 'automatic' levels you get for doing certain things often, kinda like in Skyrim. It feels like they wanted to shoot for the moon with this level system, but in the end it's (too) convoluted.

- Menus are not fully mouse driven. There's an 'ESC=back' prompt that you can't click on - you have to hit the ESC key. Dismanteling items is by pressing Z - again no support for a mouse click. The list goes on...

- Speaking of the menus: the menu cursor sucks, it just sucks. A giant square thing that you can't intuitively point at things, really? Not a fan of that.

- I don't like the name 'V' - seems like a placeholder to me. The whole lore behind the game is so rich and creative, yet our main character is just called V... If it's because you can play as a guy or girl - Mass Effect already solved that problem like 10+ years ago.

- Braindance sounded cool in presentation, but is actually pretty clunky to execute in my opinion.

- NPC AI and the police system in this game are both broken.

- You find way too damn much stuff to pick up in this game. Literally a crapton of useless items. Every enemy you kill drops something, and more often than not it's something worse than what you're already using. So you're going into the inventory, comparing your stuff and then selling/dismanteling what you don't need. Rince and repeat. Feels like I'm playing Borderlands or something... The loot system is broken in this game as far as I'm concerned, and the devs know it: there is a perk you can unlock, that automatically dismantles 'junk' items to their raw materials (that you need for crafting) at the moment you pick them up. AND there are vending machines all over the city that basically serve no other purpose than to sell stuff you don't need in case you've loaded up too much (there's a weight limit in the game).

(I realize that some or all of these 'minor' things can be fixed via patches as times goes by.)

Cyberpunk 2077 has a good main plot and Night City is an awesome setting for this story. It is NOT a milestone like The Witcher 3 though and I'm struggling to find any justification for all the hype the game got. Ubisoft craps out a game like this almost every year, and CDPR needed like 8 years for this? Since the reveal back in like 2012, I hoped this would go much more in the Deus Ex direction and not so much towards this typical open world formula. Turns out I was wrong. The argument could even be made that Night City is so big now that all the detail that went into it almost can't be appreciated anymore, and a more condensed version would have been better. The first view of the city from the balcony in the Dorsett mission was breathtaking (haha), but later you less and less feel that way because it's too big, too much almost.

Speaking of the main plot: It's disappointing that Night City turns out to only be an open world playground. The city doesn't evolve/change over the course of the game - which I really thought it would given the synopsys of an 'immortality chip' that V somehow gets a hold of and because of all the 'we have city to burn' BS. I thought that a new corporate war would break out in Night City because of this, since the lore in CP 2020 is basically all about the corporate wars. Turns out, the city is basically just a huge, overall pretty static prop and nothing more.

I want to make one thing clear again: My rating of the game has nothing to do with bugs or glitches or the botched console versions. This is only about game design, promises being broken and expectations not being met.",False
"Not compatible with the PES (Potato Entertainment System).

I have a pretty strong rig and playing it at max settings with ray tracing but at 60fps. I'm scared to run the game at 144fps as it may convert my PC into a portable heater, eventually causing an explosion.

10/10 - no bugs encountered just yet. Enjoying the game. Traumatised from seeing my character's p3n!s.

Definitely worth 8 years of waiting.",True
"It's not good. It's not bad. It's meh. The fun is there until you realize like 30 hours in the game is shallow garbage. Linear story. No faction systems. Fixers are implemented poorly. It's just a mess. Hopefully they fix it. I played Deus Ex and immediately uninstalled this crap. The difference is huge.

Also my playtime is like half from leaving it on overnight because I was drinking and fell asleep haha.",False
"Unfortunately, this game turned out to be pretty disappointing overall. The shooting and hacking mechanics were fun and engaging but I was extremely underwhelmed while being in Night City. The story is short and I never found myself getting attached to any of the characters. Even the characters that you can develop relationships with. It's weird saying this since CDPR is capable of creating games like WITCHER 3!! Cyberpunk is a huge step in the opposite direction. I feel like the primary focus was making the game ""look"" good, which it does. On PC's. Cyberpunk by far is one of the best looking games. Period. Night City is a beautiful environment that represents the Cyberpunk theme very well. However, I do not buy games simply because they look good. I would rather have a game with good/decent graphics but offers a rich and engaging story instead of a game that has amazing graphics but a boring story. I've been looking forward to booting up Witcher 3 for another full playthrough as I find this game highly replayable. Cyberpunk? Not so much. I'm trying to get as much as I can out of the game but once I stop playing, I can't see myself picking it up again in the future. This game was not finished. The amount of bugs I've been experiencing is infuriating. It truly does ruin the gaming experience. A particular mission that requires the player to ""hack"" a computer simply results in my player freezing in place, unable to move, forcing me to reload the game from a previous save point. If I could do it over. I'd wait to buy Cyberpunk. I'd even wait till it was on sale because I do not believe the experience they released is worth full retail.",False
Haven't had many bugs with the game. But under the skin of the bugs the gameplay and story is very good. Though i would recommend for a while till they patch out some more of the bugs.,True
"I'll preface this by saying that the world of this game really appeals as an interesting story, which if you don't agree with it may be hard to overlook the negatives.

[b] Starting with the issues [/b]
It's not really realistic to ignore the poor optimization and significant amount of glitches and bugs. Just in my own experience, I've encountered numerous small immersion breaking bugs that really indicate a lack of polish and a rushed decv cycle. I've not experienced any crashes (Yet lol), but the optimization is crap, I have a 1080ti STRIX running 1440p and I rarely push more than 60 frames on medium settings and they dip hugely when driving or walking through dense areas of the map. From my own research this could be because the game on default only uses something like 3GB of VRAM, which I'm sure, if not CDPR, someone will make a mod to fix it.

Other gameplay aspects such as driving and especially melee were kinda disappointing, the cars feel like they have no weight behind them and I have already seen a few mods come out attempting to fix them. As for the melee, oof, it's downright awful, the beat on the brat quests highlight the issue quite clearly. Unless you spec totally into athletics and body you stand almost zero chance at winning unless you can land literally hunderds of hits without being hit back once.

[b] Now for the good parts [/b]
The story and worldbuilding is something that I was really impressed by, the characters arcs and stories are really fleshed out and you feel motivated to continue the questlines of characters. The immersion in the world is also something that is big for me and they've done a great job at not making you feel like the centre of the world. 

The gunplay while obviously not as good as dedicated shooters, is still serviceable and I have at times found it to be very enjoyable, although I am a general fan of looter shooters such as borderlands so take that with a grain of salt. The combat more generally is really quite interesting and I am definitely a fan of the quickhack system and the open ended approach to combat encounters.

The Music, got damn its great, probably one of the strongest aspects of the game, especially The Rebel Path, or Johnny Silverhands theme, I would for sure put it up there with the DOOM soundtrack.

[b] Die Hard Fans [/b]
There's no doubt I really enjoy this game, however I partly put that down to having not bought into the hype. The reason games like The Witcher are seen as so ""good"" is because of expectations. No one expected it to be as good as it was and this is a common theme with successful games, some that come to mind are Undertale, fortnite heck even minecraft is a good example. If you claim that this is the ""Best game in the history of games and if you're critical of it you are just wrong"" you're only lying to yourself, this game is not the best game ever and it had zero chance of living up the the monumental hype it generated. I believe Critikal had some really interesting points that I agree with quite strongly on this topic.
 
That being said, if you go in with realistic expectations, you'll probably still enjoy playing :)",True
"I'm splitting this review into 4 parts:
1. General Opinion
2. What type of [RPG] game this is
3. Gameplay
4. Performance + recommendations

1. General Opinion
The most amazing thing about this game to me is the variety of big events that take place, (even in side quests). For example (and without spoiling anything), during a side quest chain there is a very big weather event, and when it happened I was just thinking ""WTF this is amazing!"" and then later I remembered it was [i]just[/i] a side quest-- the entire game is like this. The way the game play and environment is able to change really helps make you forget this is a game, because Cyberpunk doesn't seem stuck to same gameplay loops as much as other games are.

2. What type of [RPG] game this is
This game is also an open-world RPG game similar to the Witcher 3, and not like an Elder Scrolls RPG. You are very much playing a character that already exists, there are decisions that matter. And, when there are decisions that matter there are usually only 1-2 options that are very 'black and white'. 
The combat gameplay within the world does give you a lot of choices. There are many different types of guns, melee weapons, and you can also hack to do damage. The guns and melee weapons feel very fluid and good to use, hacking can feel a bit clunkier at times. There are perk trees for every type of weapon you can use, as well as hacking. There are also perk trees for the different ways you might go about combat, like stealth versus just running in. Cybernetic implants also seem to be like additional ""perk trees"", and can also add some really cool mechanics like, being able to jump higher, slow time, or shoot projectiles out of your arms.

3. Gameplay
Additionally all of the different ways you chose to go about playing the game seem to be completely supported in most quests. For example, most quests have at multiple stealth routes you can find. Then various obstacles serve as skill checks, but there's almost always different routes for the different skill checks. For example, you sneak behind an enemy building and come a cross a door that requires 8 Technology to pass, which if you skip you might have to sneak behind more enemies but might come across a door with a Body or Intelligence requirement to pass. I could honestly go into much, much, more detail about the different ways you can go through different quests but I won't. You should really experience it, and if you're like me and like seeing if you can break the quests do it. You'll be surprised by how accommodating this game is.

4. Performance + recommendations
My specs:
I played this game on pretty dated hardware at this point: i7 3970x, 16GB 1866 CL9 ram, and a Titan X (maxwell) nothing OCed. My CPU & GPU are roughly the same performance as a i7 5820k and a 980 ti, at most ~10% better.

General performance:
I played this game mainly on medium settings at 1440p with 40-60 fps, with some exceptions.

Settings + recommendations:
[b]Resolution: 2560x1440[/b] Try to go slightly higher than the resolution you want to use, will explain at end
[b]Texture quality: High [/b] This setting will either wreck your FPS or do almost nothing, depends on your VRAM and VRAM bandwidth. Medium and high are pretty similar.
[b]FOV: 85%[/b] The story takes place in your POV, doing a wider FOV will not only lower FPS (slightly) but also make people's faces more zoomed out. I recommend 85% at most
[b] everything else under ""basic"" [/b] turn off, unless you really like how it looks.
[b]**Contact Shadows: ON [/b] There are shadows that don't appear until you are right next to the object or character, leaving this off will cause distracting missing shadows.
[b]***Improved Facial Lighting Geometry: ON [/b] Makes faces in dialog much more realistic, seems to also only be active when super close to someone like with contact shadows.
[b] Anisotropy: 16x [/b] Like with the texture quality, this has very little on performance or a lot, depending on your VRAM. This should use very little VRAM especially if your resolution is lower.
[b] *Cascaded Shadow Range: High [/b] This is a taxing setting, but will help reduce flickering/pixelation from shadows.
[b] *Cascaded Shadows Resolution: Medium [/b] IIRC there was a big performance difference between medium and high but little visual difference.
[b] Distant Shadows Resolution: High [/b] This is another 'VRAM' setting
[b] Volumetric Fog Resolution: Low [/b] having this on low is pretty unnoticeable
[b] Volumetric Cloud quality: OFF [/b] This is a very taxing setting, but turning it completely off is not distracting at all. So, I highly recommend turning it off if you need more performance.
[b] Max Dynamic Decals: High [/b] I think this is another 'VRAM' setting, but not entirely sure. Seems to have little impact on framerate.
[b] Screen Space Reflections Quality: OFF [/b] Extremely taxing setting, will also often look horrible unless on the ""psycho"" setting. So IMO unless you can afford the psycho setting just turn it off.
[b] *Subsurface Scattering quality: High [/b] some objects/surfaces will look very static-y and flicker-y with lower settings.
[b] Ambient Occlusion: OFF [/b] Just taxing, the way lighting is handled is great having AO off will give a cleaner image. You might like it with it on though, this setting is preference IMO.
[b] Color precision: High [/b]
[b] ***Mirror Quality: High [/b] This setting is stupid important, it should always be on high, it seems to have no impact on anything aside from when you physically interact with a mirror... Which really only happens in important story moments, any setting aside from high will make your character look extremely pixelated.
[b] Level of Detail: High [/b] this is the distance where higher resolution models and textures get used, this just gets more important if you are playing the game at higher resolutions. Also playing at a lower setting might not be distracting to you, depends how you play imo.
[b] ***Static FidelityFX CAS: 80% [/b] There's no AA setting in the game and many objects seem to use dithering, like hair. This combination basically makes you [i] need [/i] AA to have a clean image, but can't. Using DLSS or Static FidelityFX will give you a similar end result as having multiple types of AA on, the more you scale down the stronger the AA. DLSS will give you a better image and performance if you have it available to you, which I don't. Static FIdelityFX at 80% coming from 1440p, seems to be a pretty good balance of getting rid of dithering artifacts on hair without everything else becoming a blurry mess.

[b] If you have less GPU performance than me: [/b]
1. Lower resolution to ~1080p 
2. See if medium or high textures has a big impact, and then try a lower level of detail
3. Lower your FOV if it's really high and going lower isn't uncomfortable to you
4. Lower cascaded shadow range, then cascaded shadow quality
5. Lower subsurface scattering quality (this will give you a big performance boost but at a big visual cost)

If you have to lower subsurface scattering quality but then get a good framerate, you should go back and raise the shadow settings. If lowering subsurface scattering quality doesn't give you a good frame rate just go through the steps again.

[b] if you are CPU bottlenecked: [/b]
1. ""gameplay tab"" lower ""Crow density""
2. ""interface"" turn off ""crowds on minimap""
3. Lock your FPS or set a lower maximum FPS

[b] If you have more GPU performance than me: [/b]
1. Raise the resolution and (if you can) turn on DLSS performance or quality (you might want to test these again later)
2. Turn on and test SS reflections on the psycho setting (TBH you might not like how it looks even then)
3. Turn on and progressively raise Volumetric Cloud Quality and Volumetric Cloud Resolution

I'm not sure if this happens when you turn on ray-tracing, but if ray-tracing doesn't turn off screen space reflections turn it off manually, they effectively do the same thing.",True
"Cyberpunk 2077 must be one of the buggiest games I've ever played which wasn't flagged - and priced - as Early Access. 

Most of the game mechanics and systems are bugged. Some of the core features such as the AI, the crime system or the RPG progression are so broken that I can't even imagine how they could ""fix"" them in a reasonable amount of time.

Problem is, that all these bugs and balancing issues made the overall experience completely unenjoyable - or even frustrating - to me: cinematic sections with broken animations and clipping objects, dialogs that frequently overlaps between each others, cloths and weapons stats scaling that make the crafting useless, boss fight that offer no challenge, a bare-bones traffic and crowd system, end-game cyber upgrades that are worse than ""common"" weapons looted in the open world... And the list could go on.

But hey, at least Night City is freaking gorgeus and the characters are decently written.

I would strongly suggest to wait a few months before sinking 60€ into this game, even if you have the hardware to make it run properly. It's just poorly made, bugged and inferior to other immersive-sims. If you haven't, just get Deus Ex Human Revolution and Makind Divided, which in terms of systems, RPG elements, meaningful player choices and overall fun factor are both superior to Cyberpunk 2077.",False
"Good ubisoft game, bad CDPR game",False
"(No Spoilers)

This is one of those games where you wish steam had more than just a yes or no for reviews. Get ready for an excessive amount of commas, because it's time to dump some thoughts.

Most of it boils down to the massive amount of bugs in the game, gamebreaking and otherwise. Let's be real here, it needed at least another six months of pure bug squashing before release.

I don't know if the people that claim to have encountered zero bugs are incredibly lucky, unobservant, or just straight up lying. I must have encountered [i]at least[/i] a hundred different bugs in under 10 hours of gameplay. I'm not exaggerating here. Thankfully only three of those were gamebreaking bugs - requiring me to load a previous save in order to continue playing - with the rest being visual, audio, and gameplay bugs. I haven't experienced a single crash in the time i've played, so it has that going for it. (List of bugs I've experienced at the end of the review.)

Controls are a bit of a mess as well. Because of the fairly low framerate throughout the game, mouse movement feels choppy and sluggish to me. In addition to this, the game keeps hijacking the player's camera to focus on events or items - which works fine on consoles but is a terrible experience on kb/m. The keybinds also leave a lot to be desired. There are a lot of unnecessarily separated and oddly bound keys. For example, numkeys 1 and 3 are used to cycle through cameras, C is used for both crouch AND skip diologue, double tapping a movement key makes you dodge, and various other oddities. I like to explore while characters talk, and often ended up accidentally skipping a fair few lines of conversation before getting fed up and changing the binds. I've also fallen off rooftops and jumped out of cover by accidentally double tapping a movement key. Microadjustments for positioning are essential, so unintentional dodging is unavoidable. Then there's the leaning keybinds, which are completely missing! You can auto-lean by getting up close to some cover, but I have yet to find a game where this doesn't feel wrong on kb/m.  I think they made an honest attempt to adapt the controls to PC, but the game was clearly designed for controllers. 

As far as graphics options go, it's a good port - very customizable and includes all the newer toys like DLSS. And that's a good thing, because DLSS in particular is pretty much a requirement to get playable FPS. The graphics look good, but not good enough to justify the terrible performance. Obviously, this will improve as new hardware comes out, but I feel like they bit off more than anyone else can chew with this one. For those who are fine with an inconsistent 30-60fps and horrible graphics, you'll probably have a fine time. I play on an RTX 2070 Super, i7-7700k, 1440p 144hz monitor, installed on an SSD, with DLSS enabled (Auto), Ray tracing disabled, and most of the settings at low or medium. I also tested the game on older Nvidia drivers, as well as the most recent one. No crashing on either. I switched between 1080p and 1440p often but saw a negligable difference in framerate. I managed to get anywhere from 30 to 70fps around the city, and barely up to 100fps in some isolated missions. I can't tell if the game is unoptimized, or if they have too much on screen at once... or both. It doesn't really matter because you will need to play it in potato mode to keep the choppiness to a minimum. This is still far better than consoles, especially when you utilize the expansive options we have on PC, but not an ideal experience in any way.

So I guess that brings me to the gameplay and story (No spoilers, still). I'm not basing this review on the story overall, because I haven't played through the whole thing yet. So far.... Yeah, it's fine. I like the characters, and I enjoy the gunplay. I even did some hacking and sneaking (not my normal thing), and it was a good time. Inventory management is my least favorite thing in the world - but there's plenty of inventory space and the weight limit isn't much of an issue if you allocate points in the right skill tree. Unfortunately, I do still find myself picking over every single prop in the room looking for items, even during gunfights. I wish I could just focus on the shooting, but there's so freakin' many items to loot. How can I focus on the enemy when there's LOOT to be had?

I knew that the game was way over-hyped going in, so I set my expectations far lower than most people. Unless you [i]absolutely[/i] need to play Cyberpunk right now, I recommend waiting for bug fixes, better hardware, and some additional optimizations. That said, I do like the gameplay and story, so I'll be continuing this breathtaking campaign.

--

I used shadowplay to record ~30 or so of the worst and/or funniest bugs, but sadly it only recorded my desktop instead of the game. You'll just have to settle for this non-exhaustive list off the top of my head:

Gamebreaking:
[list]
[*]During training course, an enemy disappeared or fell through the map before I completed the objective. Had to load previous checkpoint to progress.
[*]During a mission, the quest objective did not complete as it should have, but I was allowed to leave and complete side quests still. Had to load a [i]really[/i] old save to progress.
[*]During a mission, I was required to loot a body to complete an objective, but was unable. Had to load previous checkpoint to progress.
[/list]

Non Gamebreaking:

[*]Once had an enemy peeking out and shooting from cover behind a box. All normal behavior, except that he was floating SIDEWAYS on the box, horizontally rather than upright. Funniest thing I've ever seen. He popped back into the correct orientation when i ran up close to him.
[*]Had an enemy shooting at me from behind cover - completely behind cover, killed me with his gun sticking through a wall.
[*]Called the car to my location, but it never showed up. Went on a hike and found it merged with another car. When I got close, the other car exploded and was launched across the road.
[*]A character handed me an object, but their gun was attached to the object instead, in the wrong orientation. 
Early cinematics had certain animations playing at the wrong time, and then moving at double time to catch up to the rest of the scene.
[*]Audio not being synced properly during an interactive cinematic.
[*]Mouths not moving during cinematics.
[*]Invisible NPC weapons.
[*]After leaning out of a car to shoot, trying to lower weapon and go back in didn't work correctly. My camera stayed in place and I was able to turn around and see my own body without a head.
[*]Items in NPC's and character's hands constantly duplicate and remain in mid air while the original object moves as it should.
[*]Running on certain railings/barriers causes you to run across them at hyperspeed for a short time.
[*]Motorcycles can get momentarily stuck on certain surfaces, causing the front tire to bounce and slowing it to a crawl.
[*]Hair/clothes/items often disappear in mirrors and the inventory character preview.
[*]Various corpse ragdoll bugs, including weird physics, getting stuck in walls, and, occasionally, exploding into gore piles.
[*]Various UI elements permanently getting stuck on screen during gameplay.
[*]NPCs constantly popping into existence right in front of me.
[*]NPC pathing can be funky. A main character once got on a bike, turned towards me, and immediately ran me over before driving off.
[*]Allies sometimes walk at super-speed when they move to another location during missions.
[*]Many items with pick-up icon are not able to be picked up.
[*]Some monitors with interactable interfaces are not able to be ""used"". The camera doesn't zoom or lock to the interface, but things can still be clicked on and opened with the cursor.
[*]Distant buildings/sky sometimes disappear and display as a black void until they reload.

I've hit the character limit with this review, so I'll have stop the list here.",False
"I like it and I want to love it, I really do but in terms of gameplay this is pretty bare bones. Don't get me wrong, it has huge potential but at the current stage there isn't much to it, it feels like an Alpha/Beta stage game. For a game based around cybernetics, modifications etc, there is almost 0 customization apart from the character creation and this one is pretty simple, just a few premade selections and that's it. 

Unoptimized, buggy but NOT to a point that it becomes unplayable. It has a nice story line, nice side quests but the city even though it looks alive, it feels a bit static, NPCs for the most part are brainless and don't react well to the environment and for an open world game, the random encounters are quite limited. 

Driving is a painful to say the least, steering is oversensitive and physics are meh... Shooting is nice but weapon customization is also very limited. 

Hopefully they will expand and make a game out of it but at this point it sure feels like an alpha/beta phase game.",False
"Pros:
Night City is probably the most beautiful open world ever made.
The characters are very well done and you connect with them.
The story is intriguing and pulls you in.
Combat is fun regardless of which way you go (Hacking, slashing, shooting)
The ""Side Quests"" are more fun and engaging than the main story, and last longer.
Keanu Reeves was amazing.

Cons:
The performance is beyond terrible (might get fixed though).
Your ""life path"" doesn't matter (dialogue options are just flavour text).
Your story choices do not matter. And I mean at all. ( [spoiler] Your ending is based on one line of dialogue you pick 30 minutes before the credits. [/spoiler] )
The dialogue options make it seem like you have a choice, but almost always all 3 lead to the same outcome of ''Yes, I'll do it.''
There are next to no RPG elements, or at least they don't matter.
There are unironically around 8 different guns in the game and that's it. The only real variety is melee.
Random NPC's have no AI. They do nothing on the streets, don't react, don't talk, don't run away.
There is no police AI or real wanted system. Cops literally spawn on top of you if you get a wanted level.
Every single mission under ""Gigs"" and ""Hustles"" is go to X to kill Y. Rarely steal something along the way.
And my dear god are there bugs. Visual ones, bugs with physics, with missions, everything. You cannot comprehend or even imagine the amount of bugs. You will not have 10 minutes of playtime between seeing a car fly somewhere, trash explode, clothes float, people walk through objects, walk in the air, floating cigs and phones in every cutscene, T-posing everywhere, missing animations, missing audio, missing subtitles.

I, myself, still enjoyed it, looking past all the cons and bugs. But that doesn't mean it's good. It could have been a great game, but it just won't. No amount of DLC's and patches can make up for even half of these cons. CDPR needs to pull a No Mans Sky scenario, and I genuinely don't believe they will.",False
"On Ryzen 7 1700 and GTX 1070 I can barely get stable 60fps on all Low settings. No matter if it's a closed environment like a bar at the beginning of the Street Kid story or if you're roaming around in the city. The game constantly fluctuates between 30-60 fps. I guess that it's safe to say that the recommended specs were probably made for 30fps.
The game also crashed a lot during my low playtime with the game. Some of it was when doing the tutorials, some of it was during the story missions and some of it were random crashes when just roaming around the city. So save often if you don't trust the autosaves.

The gameplay is really barebones. Shooting feels fine, it's not bad, but it's not excellent neither. There's so much loot  Beware that you'll encounter a lot of bullet sponges. However, getting shot feels weird. Almost like there's no feedback is given until you're dead. Stealth is standard. It's something that you know from other games. You have non-lethal takedowns, body hiding and avoiding cameras. However, there's no unique twist about it. 

Melee feels clunky and bad. Enemies teleport to you when they are attacking and your and enemy's attacks frameskip, causing the feedback to not be great. Driving with the keyboard feels really stiff and unresponsive, the starting car and motorbikes feel really heavy. The dialogue system is the same as The Witcher. You have yellow text that moves the story forward and you have blue text that is just fluff text that just gives you more information. Your skill tree feels basic. Ex. for gun skills, most of the time you exchange your perk points for % boost damage or shortened reload time for X Y or Z. 

The city feels dead. No one talks to each other, there are barely interactions to have with peds. NPCs while driving are the most stupid NPCs I have seen in the past 5 years. If you just cut off their path, they're just gonna sit there. They're not gonna try to avoid you, ram your car or honk at you.

I feel like everything in-game happens too fast with no build-up. Jackie for example. You meet him in your origin story, at the end of the origin story he says something like ""I guess we're friends now"", so the game goes into a one-minute montage with you and him doing stuff and suddenly it's half a year later and you're best friends all of the sudden. 2 hours later and he's dead like in the trailers.

Also, your V cannot have a unique personality because the character's voiced. It's the same thing I disliked in Fallout 4

This is not an RPG, this is an FPS with some minor RPG elements and poor performance and I expected something else than design from The Witcher.",False

My Initial Thoughts:
You need the LATEST VorpX patch for this to work and the game now has a DEFAULT profile that works out the box.
There is no 3D geometry yet but Z3D works really well.

"Just really poor for the amount of time we've had to wait. This is a game I'm struggling to enjoy; the world doesn't feel immersive, the combat is janky - especially the enemy AI - and the skill trees have this great depth and progression but ultimately amounts to not much.

We'll see how it goes in 6 months' time, but I'm not overly hopeful.",False
Great game - a few small bugs but nothing that every game doesn't experience at first launch. No crashing no major glitches. People complaining about this need to calm down - it's a great game and I have faith CDPR will only make it better in the months to come.,True
This game is a huge disappointment,False
"Finished it for the first time.

First of all, I wasn't part of the hype towards the game and I'm not even a fan of the genre ''cyberpunk'' itself. 
Besides all the bugs and fails that EVERYONE knows, I'll briefly say why i recommend it.

 I think the strong factor in this game are the characters + story and your immersion into it. They're really charismatic and you'll find youself attached to some of them. The dialogs are fun to hear and answer. At least for my country, the team did a great job with the translation because it did felt like i was ''hearing'' day by day  talks with all accent, slangs and swearings. And this made the immersion way better and really fun. 
 In general, game gives A LOT of answers to choose when you're talking with someone, and it's nice that a lot of the options can really change paths or the way the characters will judge/answer you. 
 With a good story, we wish for a good ending. We can have around 7 endings and for me personally, i got one that i really liked. Not because of the ending itself but all the process that i went through it and what it gave me to imagine after watching it, was really satisfying. Meantime, it made me feel very sad and depressed and i can still feel the bittersweet and ''void inside my chest''. 

 For a lot of people, game is not playable right now and i agree that there's a lot they can do to make it better. Details to add, things to refine, bugs to fix... But it still a good game with a good story to give it a try, if not now, in the next months.",True
"aside from all the ridiculous bugs, there is just so much about this game that CDPR did NOT deliver. night city is very beautiful, but it's only a facade. there is no interactivity whatsoever compared to some other games marketed as open-world, npc and police ai is the worst i've seen, the game has little to no role-playing aspects despite making you choose the background of your character and being marketed as an RPG. hell you can't even change your character's appearance once you've confirmed it in the beginning.

i haven't yet completed the game, but i can list some positives such as great side quests so far, entertaining gameplay in general, wonderful soundtrack and a beautiful city. i will probably continue playing because these positive aspects are strong enough. but damn such a shame they shat out an unfinished game. it could've been a good game if it weren't prematurely released. i just can't get myself to recommend this game no matter how much i enjoy it due to incredibly misleading marketing and the plethora of bad choices made by CDPR.",False
"Two hours in. First impressions are good. The game starts slow. Hopefully will pick up the pace. Will update the review in the future.

30 hours in. Game did pick up the pace. Plot is shaping up nicely. Still not seen too much RPG elements as one expect. Gameplay mechanics is enjoyable so far. Night city looks stunning at times.Encountered few crashes here and there but yet to encounter game breaking bugs. Next update will be after completing the game.",True
"This game is unfinished, plain and simple. It's sad because I wanted to love this game so hard. Witcher 3 was chef's kiss. However, I can't recommend a game that's unfinished, especially one when the unfinished aspects of the game include ALMOST EVERYTHING. If there is a big update that overhauls the game, I will happily update my review accordingly. 

Why it's unfinished:
- Whether you are playing a main job or side job, you literally can't find 5 minutes of game play that isn't interrupted by some glitch or bug.
- Character movements are choppy
- Dialogue constantly overlaps between those talking
- Audio bugs throughout
- AI combat is just plain awful
- The Wanted system when you commit a crime is a joke; THE AUTHORITIES SPAWN RIGHT NEXT TO YOU
- Vehicle speed is bizarre. From what I understand is your car stops truly accelerating around 125 or so, and everything above that is just more engine noise, and no speed. 
- No vehicle customization, and strange vehicle spawning behavior. 
- Weapon variety is small, and weapon customization is almost non-existent. You're mod options are a few weapon sights, suppressor, or damage modifiers. That's it. 
- The story line is largely on rails; not many choices. 
- Exploring is unrewarding; you'll just find the same ""assault in progress"" instances. 
- There's no importance on making your character look cool because you never see your character except in the inventory (might be different for those RTX users). 
- Looting becomes tedious after realizing you'll be finding the same things over and over and over again. 
- Special/exotic weapons are largely just painted versions of normal weapons. 
- Tech weapons are insanely powerful, and even more so when upgraded by your talent tree. This is exacerbated by the dumb AI that will stand completely still as you head shot all of them through a wall. 
- Dropping from small heights has a chance to kill you outright. 
- the physics of the game are very wonky. 

In summary, the visuals in regards to the world, characters, weapons, and vehicles, which are STUNNING, gives you the sense the game you're playing will have the same quality in regards to game play, immersion, looting, progression, etc, and boy was a bummed when I realized that wasn't the case. After 60 hours of steadily realizing they released it too early, I'm regretfully putting the game away until it's fixed.",False
"Great story based game. The missions, side quests and story are rather engaging and fun but good lord is this game filled with bugs. It's almost on par with Fallout 76's release. 

The bugs are at times hilarious to see but after a while they become quite obnoxious to deal with the more consistently you see them. You also have your game breaking bugs where some mobs for whatever reason become invisible or not register bullets even if you're shooting them directly in the head. I'm finally not getting anymore crashes after the first patch so that's a start I guess.

Outside of the bugs my other gripe was the brain dead AI. It's quite awful. The only mobs that show at least some sort of intelligence are the boss mobs. But even then you'll still sometimes ""break"" them and they'll sit there and allow you to shoot bullets into their face without them responding.  If you're expecting GTA or Red Dead Redemption quality AI then you're going to be highly disappointed coming to this game.

For now I'm not recommending this game to anyone. I'll probably change my opinion whenever they start dishing out the bug fixes around January and February.",False
"The storytelling is really awesome and dont get me started about the side quests... jesus. I never laughed so hard :) and some were quite shocking tbh. Its a great game if you have good gaming pc.

So far the game was Ok, but the quality was not what I had hoped.

"This game is FAR from what was advertised. Just for the police to even chase you, you need to install a third party mod... besides the fact that any petty crime will cause cops to spawn right behind you and after 4 kills/stars, you essentially get insta-killed by the spawning cops and robots. Also, the physics and A.I. are worse than GTA III which was released in 2001. This game is pretty and the story is good but beyond that, it's a joke. The lack of development makes it very difficult to get immersed in.

If you really wanna try this title, wait a couple months for more patches because so far, even the hot fixes need hot fixes because they're introducing new bugs.

"After almost 80 hours and completing every side mission in the game, I finally finished Cyberpunk 2077. So far I’m not sure how I feel about the ending but I certainly have thoughts about the rest of the game. While I wasn’t as much into the hype as others, I still pre-ordered and got up in the middle of the night to play on launch day.

I have never felt so ambivalent about a game before. It’s not a 3/10 or 6/10 or 10/10 because I cannot possibly merge the things I loved and the things I hated into one score. Here’s my random thoughts on the aspects that I liked and those I really didn’t.

----------

[b]THE GOOD[/b]

Night City, my god, what a beautiful, vast, varied place. At times the lighting and colours reached a level of perfection reminiscent of Control. Sundown in the desert was damn near photorealistic at times. And don’t get me started on the grimy, gloomy perfection that is Japantown and Little China.

Starting out, I went into most gigs as a stealthy hacker and got very frustrated with the unreliable detection system and how difficult it was to tell whether an enemy could be taken out safely with a quickhack or not. Then I tried going in guns blazing instead and suddenly I was playing DOOM. Seriously, the music, the pacing, jumping and sliding all over the place, it felt pretty much like DOOM and I loved it. Played the rest of the game as a complete badass with an assault rifle and the occasional quickhack.

The narrative is solid. Disregarding the disappointing tease that is Act 1, there is a lot to love here. As someone who primarily plays games for the story, I was hooked fairly soon and found myself caring for many of the characters. Some of the main missions were absolutely breathtaking (heh) and I enjoyed all the long conversations a great deal as they were very well written. The endings are a bit of a mixed bag though and I cannot possibly see how any DLC could pick up where they left off.

The music! The soundtrack is awesome (especially the DOOM-esque combat music) but what I absolutely fell in love with was the Samurai tracks by Refused. Will be listening to Never Fade Away, Chippin’ In, and Black Dog for many months to come.

Johnny, I’ll eat every last bullet in the city for you if that’s what it’s going to take. Sniff.

----------

[b]THE BAD[/b]

The original story line and premise were probably scrapped at some point in development to be replaced by what we have now. Bits of it can still be found in the life paths and the entire Act 1, leaving a decidedly bitter taste of what could have been. While I like the narrative that we did get, I felt that Act 1 promised a very different game and it should have been several hours longer at the very least. [spoiler]Developing that friendship with Jackie should never have been relegated to an action montage. The game tells you (briefly) why V cares about Jackie but it never tells you why you, the player, should, and so it all falls flat.[/spoiler]

Customisation. There is none. Why do I sink hours upon hours into open world RPGs? Because I can customise my character to a T on my adventures. Appearance, equipment, weapons, mounts/vehicles, perks. I was so certain there would be barbers and tattoo parlors in this game, I didn’t even bother looking it up. In reality, there is nothing. No visual customisation at all, and the stat customisation is utterly boring. You can replace your eyeballs but you can’t cut your hair. There is no vehicle customisation whatsoever. No visible weapon customisation either, and I fail to see where +5% limb damage mods is compelling personalisation of your equipment. There are many perks but the vast majority of them is as boring and uninspired as the weapon/clothing mods. There was plenty of misleading marketing but this for me was the worst. Fashion is everything in Night City? Fuck off. There isn’t even a single decent hat in the entire fucking town.

There is no roleplaying. Dialogue options are very basic and decisions far and few between. V is not going to change based on your actions (or at all, really). 

Romance options are limited to say the least. To avoid spoilers, I’ll simply say that after getting together, there’s nothing more going to happen until the very end. Oh, you can move in with your love interest - that is, an icon will appear on your map designating their place as one of your apartments / safe house but there is absolutely no point - unless CDPR seriously expects me to drive across town to make stupid faces in my boyfriend’s mirror.

The NPCs and AI. This has been discussed in many places so I won’t go into too much detail. Whenever danger breaks out, NPCs crouch down into a generic position that looks like a placeholder. Sometimes they panic because I sprint. The police system is a complete joke. They don’t give a shit when I go on a rampage trying to drive my bloody car but for some reason get real touchy when I look at them while passing by.

After many years of modding Skyrim, I thought I was resistant enough to not be annoyed by any bugs I might encounter. Boy, was I wrong. The glitches, visual and otherwise, just happen constantly, taking a crap on immersion at every turn. Quests get stuck and require you to reload an earlier save. During one long main mission, a 5 second audio loop from an earlier cutscene got stuck for about ten minutes, playing over relevant dialogue. Since the mission kept going, I couldn’t save/reload to fix it either so it ruined the whole thing. At least the game didn’t crash on me. Yay?

The performance ranges from decent to utterly atrocious. I realise that my processor is getting somewhat outdated (i5 7600k @4.2GHz) and was certainly bottle-necking my GPU (RTX 3080 bought specifically for Cyberpunk). Playing at 1440p with many of the settings turned down and crowd density set to medium, my frame rate would still drop below 20 in the Downtown area which is a bad joke. Outside the city it sat at a comfortable 70-80FPS but as soon as I got closer to the city centre, the game turned into a sluggish, unresponsive mess.

----------

[b]THE CONCLUSION[/b]

I enjoyed the game a great deal. I am also severely disappointed. Cyberpunk 2077 is a rough, unpolished experience that clearly needed more time in the oven. What’s there is (for the most part) very good but constantly overshadowed by what could have been.

Overall, I just cannot recommend the game in its current state.",False
"[h1] The best early access game I've played [/h1]

The game is a shitfest of bugs and has a terrible technical side, some settings won´t even work (LoD is totally useless and broken). The AI is the dumbest I´ve encountered in a looooong time, really dumb for real.

Add that to the content that was cut, lack of some basic things (ALLOW ME TO WALK FFS), the game is not what they said it would be (the RPG thing is even gone from the twitter page, now is just an action game), standard shooting experience among some other things I would say it's a terrible game.

[b] BUT [/b]

What I really wanted from this game was a story and good characters, and boy I got that.
The main arc is good, short, but good. I choose the good ending [spoiler] aldecaldos ending [/spoiler] so I am really happy with that. Johnny has a good character development, I grew to like him and [spoiler] even knowing how things were going to end with him it was not and easy task, his final words to V hit me more than I thought it would [/spoiler]. But the real thing here are the secondary arcs and the world itself. Reading the shards, or messages between the people living there gives you a better understanding of how fucked up NC is.

There are some really good secondary missions [spoiler] the crucifixion one is great and quite disturbing [/spoiler]. You get to meet a sort of [spoiler] GLaDOS [/spoiler] on Delamain missions and even a guy who got  a bad d*ck implant. The Gigs are simple, classic open world mission of go here and steal/kill, some of them offer a little twist where you can spare or not your target after talking to them.

The cherry on top here are the secondary characters arcs. You get to really see how they are, behave and think about the city and life itself, and I loved that. The voice acting is great, not just on V (female) but on her friends too.

Visually is so beautiful, the art team really carry the game here. The look and feel of the city (not the dumb and bugged AI) is amazing, I spent hours just driving and walking around NC, The music is great too, good tunes on the radio and the OST is perfect.

So the bugs that I mentioned earlier? Yes, they are there, yes there are things missing but I got what I wanted with the story and world itself so that's why I am giving this game a positive review and I know that CDPR will fix some of this things making it better in the future and tho they may never reach what they first promised is a good game nonetheless.",True
"It is definitely one of the most demanding games on the market, but my god is it amazing. If you have the hardware to run this game with Ray Tracing it's worth every dollar.

"E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy for people with sub-150 IQ. Buggy as shit, but you can tell they rushed to get that bitch out the oven due to complaints. I personally wouldn't spend a full $60 USD on it, but if you can catch it for like $40 or less, I'd say it's worth it.",True
"If you don't own an RT card (specifically NVIDIA for DLSS) your experience will be severely degraded at higher resolutions, to the point you have to use the AMD dynamic resolution scaling, and the game just looks like it was released in 2012.

Besides the graphics, this game has some weird pacing. [NO SPOILERS] Act 1 is full of exposition and dialogue, and very little actual gameplay. Loot is EVERYWHERE to the point that it clogs up the UI and you have no idea what to pick up in the first place. Act 2 you actually get to play the game, but in order to play, better get ready to RUN everywhere and get spammed by so many different NPC's while you run around.",False
"Disappointment and a scam. 2 years wasted on developing a E3 Demo that did not contribute a lot to the final game, then under delivering on the product with a lot of features cut. Not a fan of how the developers were treated, with a year of crunch and management not listening to staff.

To summarise my experience with the game:

Good: 
- Great story, with lots of good side missions.
- Good gun play and feel for most weapons.
- World looks amazing and interesting.
- Lots of interesting characters.
- Vehicles attention to detail is amazing.

Bad:
- Laughably bad A.I, mostly present in the cop system and the AI not knowing how to deal with you at range. The spotting mechanic is also under developed.
- Lack of development and polish on most missions. You can easily see the missions have not been developed for a long time, most of them are in a rough state, with bad way points and triggers for missions.
- Crafting system is seriously underdeveloped. Easily exploitable.
- Runs like garbage. The game looks great for the most part, but is lacking a lot of CPU and GPU optimisation.
- Some of the stats in the game don't calculate correctly. If you stack Crit chance for example, then most of it won't correctly apply to your characters stats.
- Upgrading could use a refresh, it's extremely expensive to upgrade weapons and armor to your level.
- No Cosmetic Vehicle, Apartment, weapon and clothing customization.
- Vehicle's have unrealistic driving models and are difficult to control. Some of the vehicles sounds to rev's are out of sync.
- Mini map doesn't scale to your speed, so when driving quickly you'll miss your turn due to map staying zoomed in.
- Lack of world building activities and events. Besides missions, there isn't a lot you can do.
- Lots of cut features and content that was shown. The character's back stories choice is also a joke, you basically play street kid after the 20 minute introduction mission.
- For most of the game, your choice doesn't matter.

Just avoid it for now. Wish the management of this game would have listened to their development teams and waited till 2022 to release this game.",False

"GIVE THIS ONE A READ BEFORE BUYING THIS!!

So I dumped some pretty good hours into this, and I have alot of pros and cons to make for this.
Given how the game was delayed and in development for so long was the game worth the hype? Most certainly not, and I believe all games should be met with low expectations so you wont be as disappointed.
So, where do I begin...

MY PROS:
-Beautiful graphics
-Gameplay with melee and guns at times feels satisfying
-Johnny Silverhand/Keanu Reeves is a easy +1
-The story has intriguing moments, and the pathways for your life is also interesting as well, because street kid, nomad, and corp allows you different dialouge options and info gathering, thankfully it doesnt highly effect your game mostly the prolouge.
-The skills are well made and fun to play around with for specific builds and how you wish to strengthen your character
-The character customization IS TOP NOTCH, you can be a male, female, trans male, trans female, you can modify just about every part of your body (yes even those parts).
-The cyber modifications are also really fun to play with and gives you a upper hand with situations, the one that helped me the most was the double jump
-Big open world filled with quests and weapons/gear to experiment and play around on

MY CONS:
-The glitches... and there is too many here for me to list
-I am not sure if its me but whenever I am in a apartment I have 60 fps, but as soon as I go to night city my frames drop to around 30-40 fps, and this is with my rtx 2080ti pc, could be a drivers issue I am not sure.
-The fact you cant change your characters appearance once you already made them, so if you made a character that doesn't look how you want it to then you will be haunted the rest of the game for it.
-The lack of romantic scenes and partners, it might just be me but for a game with ""lots of freedom""it would be cool trying to date or romance like gang members or more npcs as the game progresses
-Its obviously not finished, it feels like I am playing a beta the longer I dwell in this game because there is a large world that consists of quest, which mostly involves your everyday kill em and get the money/xp I dont mind this to an extent, I just wished they added more options like customizing cars, homes, etc. Hopefully with patches and such this can be solved.
-The level cap being 50 feels restricting and its a shame that you cant go any further, maybe a raise in level cap to 60 or more would be wonderful but thats just my opinion.

In short, I think cyberpunk 2077 has a good concept, runs decently well and it has alot of potential to being a better game then it is now, at the moment I can only recommend this game if you are wanting to play and stay up to date with it like I am to see how it can make itself better and HOPEFULLY meet alot of peoples satisfaction, otherwise give it a wait or so if you wanna see it look and play better before purchasing this.
I am gonna have to give this game a 5/10 for now, but if the game added what I listed above it would be a 8/10 for me. It is not a bad game by anymeans, it just feels like a unfinished product riddled with bugs and lacking alot of content that can be filled.

"You know, if they'd just waited another two weeks and brought this thing out with the 1.0.6 patch, I imagine CDPR wouldn't be in nearly as much shit as they are right now. Most of the stupid glitches that were ruining the game (like Keanu Reeves leaving a trail of floating cigarettes everywhere he walks) have been sorted out since then, and the game did run pretty well on medium on my 5 year old machine. But well, I guess the corpos got what they wanted or whatever. 

Anyway, once the technical problems are set aside, this was actually a very good game with a cool story line.  A few comments:

1) The most difficult part of the game is finding the good content. 

There are probably about 25 really great side quests in the game that feature unique characters and story arcs that are worth your time, while there are probably about 75 generic 'kill everyone in the building and put the loot in the drop point'. All of these quests are generally marked with '?' or '!' marks on the map and good luck trying to figure out which is which. Add a bunch of markers on the map that show cars and motorcycles for sale and you've got a right mess. This shit needed to be color coded so that I knew which ones were just warehouses full of assholes and which ones they really put effort into. 

2) The combat sucks. 

I mean, Witcher's combat kind of sucked too, but it's worth saying. At normal difficulty, I could walk into any of the aforementioned warehouses, take out my sword and kill everyone before you could say bankai. I could have pumped it to hard sure, but why would I do this? No one's playing this because they really want a gritty and challenging warehouse fight. 

3) The open world also sucks. 

I mean, even back in Morrowind there was a whole thing with stealing things. In this, you see something on the ground, you loot it. You can even go loot your best friend's grave while his mother looks on with zero consequences.  If you kill someone while driving (which you will because these cars do not control well), the police are instantly informed and start shooting at you, but they'll give up if you drive two city blocks away. If we were to compare what's going on in Night City with what was achieved in something like Red Dead, then well... Night City ain't going to come out looking too well. 

That said, I do like the layout of the city and how downtown has denser traffic than the outskirts. That's all neat. 

4) The story starts out shaky but gets better as it goes. 

You don't have Keanu Reeves in the story until you're a good chunk in, but once you get him and his role in the story is fleshed out, things start to click. Johnny Silverhand is the heart and soul of the game and it's his running commentary on all the side quests you do that give the game life. Getting to hear him deliver a few sardonic remarks about how everything blows is what will keep you going through the warehouse fights.  

Speaking of that...

5) Keanu Reeves was good. 

I've never seen a game where a big movie actor was given literal face time before, but he at least makes the best of it. His character is ridiculous on paper. He's a military-vet turned rockstar turned anti-capitalist revolutionary who drinks and parties hard and is completely irresistible to women. Johnny Silverhand's backstory is a childish mishmash of cool stuff that ought to have fallen apart, but Keanu Reeves' performance does genuinely add nuance to it that I think would not have been possible otherwise. 

I'm not sure how many millions CDPR had to pay to bring him in, but Johnny Silverhand is present for 80% of the game and Keanu clearly did his best to earn the paycheque. 

Overall: A great game. Not Game of the Year (which went to Witcher 3 again), but still great.",True

"TL;DR
GAME: 8/10
PROMISES: -9001/10
TRUST IN CDPR: ZERO
re-reviewing in the future...

So here is the deal: Framing is everything. If CDPR said that this was a first try at something like this and it needed work then just released the game I would give it a up vote. THERE IS A GOOD GAME HERE despite all the flaws. But instead they promised a bunch of stuff that wasn't delivered, send out a world that obviously wasn't done, had huge missing features that I can't help but to wonder if they will ever exist and then, as some sort of messed up icing to the top of the cake, had huge bugs some of which break or prevent progress. All of this is just sad really. I just wish I wasn't lied to. A really good idea botched by terrible management.
The game is a mess even now on 1.12 I will update in the future with the hope that I can say they finally delivered.

"Cyberpunk 2077 was one of the most highly anticipated games of this decade. I knew it would be unlikely to meet the sky high expectations set by the gaming community. After playing it, I must say I'm happy with what I'm seeing so far. Sure, there are a few bugs and the game can be optimized better. But the most important aspects of the game, story and gameplay are both impressive.

I highly recommend it as it's great fun and I'm certain based on CD Projekt Red's track record the few issues will be fixed in time. If you're a fan of rpg and open world games, this is the game for you.

Some gripes I have are:

1.) not being able to use third-person view while on foot is disappointing. i would very much like to observe my own character when doing various things, like reactions during conversations and such. that is to say, if they even exist. i could give more scenarios in which it would be nice to observe your own character during gameplay.

2.) it is sometimes difficult to interact with, or loot, some items in the game world when there are too many close to each other.

3.) i find it sometimes impossible to park your vehicle the way you want when approaching certain spots. the game forces you out of your vehicle.

4.) setting a waypoint on the map you want to travel to is atrociously difficult. you want to set the marker to the street, but buildings cover the street and the game doesn't pick up on where you actually want to travel to. which results in an awkward given path not leading to where you actually want to go.

5.) free roam capabilities are very limited and require more progress through main missions to accomplish. the game forces you backwards when attempting to free roam too far.

"[h1]The only reason I've played this much is because I was starved for an open-world cyberpunk game with character customization.[/h1]
Apparently CD PR considers PC version to be ""good"" so I feel I must leave a review now.

Aside from the myriad of well-documented [b]bugs[/b] that start from the very first minutes of playing during customization process itself, there are issues like:

[b]- Quality of life issues[/b]
[i]crafting items[/i] 1 by 1 takes 2 seconds when you need [u]hundreds[/u] of them is tedious - need crafting in batches,
[i]1st person driving view[/i] is unusable - what waste of detailed vehicle interiors to never see them in action,
[i]minimap[/i] doesn't zoom out enough at higher speeds - making the player miss turns very often,
[i]enemy marking[/i] will mark objects like doorways and explosive canisters that are in front of enemy,
[i]unrebindable dashing[/i] breaks stealth and immersion especially when trying to loot,
[i]throwing a knife[/i] doesn't put a new one in your slot automatically, also it destroys the knife after thrown - a bug?

[b]-Missing/cut features[/b] that were shown in gameplay trailers or mentioned in official interviews (monowire doesn't hack, only 1 crib, no metros, no spiderdrone, no wallrunning, no leaning out of car, no NPC routines)

[b]-Lack of very obvious immersive features[/b] (no barbers, no designated tattoo parlors, can't eat at foodstands, no garage, no personal radio, no mini-games, no fun activities). 
Honestly, after completing all of quests (around 70 hours) there is nothing left to do.

[b]-Clunky key-mapping choices.[/b] Took me a while to find a comfortable layout.

[b]-Lack of updates and little communication from the dev team.[/b] It's been over 3 weeks since 1.06 Hotfix, which itself was only two small fixes. It feels like waiting for rain in the desert.

[b]-Performance.[/b] I cannot get 60 fps on native resolution even on low with my GTX 1650. I ended up playing on medium capped at 30 fps. Lowering crowd density helps a lot. Hacking multiple environmental objects over time starts to lag, I think the game doesn't despawn objects, bodies and car wrecks as often as it should if at all. NPCs on the other hand despawn as soon as you turn around, not super noticeable though.

[b]-Car and NPC AI is really bad.[/b] Cars can't drive around a vehicle if it protrudes into the street at least a little bit, your vehicle will spawn inside of ground or other cars, NPCs freak out when accidentally dashing into them, cops are basically just another gang out to get you. There are events where cops are fighting another gang, but they will not engage them outside of such scenarios in an emergent fashion. In fact if a cop spots a gangster body they will decide to hunt the player as if it was a crime. Cops will teleport right to the player even in the forsaken Pacifica district or inside of a secluded apartment when a crime is commited. When stealthing temporary companions will run right under enemy noses undetected and then complain that V will get spotted. There are like 4 different ways of disabling cameras, except they sometimes turn back on as soon as the player is in view. Racing or following another car are unfair as the cars will either teleport closer behind the player or speed up ahead respectively in order to stay at least a certain distance from the player.

[b]-Low replay-value for RPG fans.[/b] Lifepath dialog choices matter little, some unskippable scenes, voiced protagonists severely limit the role-playing potential with no option to mute V, failing timed choices doesn't matter or results in death, some side quest choices that seem big don't matter.

[b]-Swimming skills and items are useless.[/b] Not a big deal, but still a waste.

[b]-Some game play mechanics aren't explained well.[/b] Double-tapping radio button can cycle through radios instead of needing to use the list, certain gangs are immune to smart-weapon targeting making bullets miss everything further than close range, grenade launcher mod for the hands has infinite ammo and doesn't use existing grenades, netrunning perk that should prevent RAM from depleting below a certain amount doesn't work, rerouting an occasional fusebox with engineering unlocks something but it isn't clear what.

[b]-Experimentaion with attribute points is punished.[/b]. Perk points can be reset and reallocated for a price, but not attribute points that go into Body, Intelligence, Reflex, Cool and Engineering. And with a level cap of 50 it's possible to run out of attribute points. Boxing quest line is a big waste of body points for example for little pay-off. Engineering on the other hand is too good not to pick as it opens many locked doors, tech weapon handling, crafting, disassembling and upgrading items. Also, grinding skills at levels 18-20 (max) takes far too long for the game's amount of content

[b]-Nothing to spend hoards of money on except cars in mid to late game.[/b] If you're not a collector all you need is 200k or so to get decent cyberware and a fast bike. Extra cash should allow to buy apartments or make some other meaningful purchases besides vehicles.

[b]Now the things that were done well:[/b]

-The selection and the amount of detail of [i]augmentations, clothes, weapons and vehicles[/i] are adequate to great.
-All [i]quests[/i] are memorable in some way and [i]quest buildings usually have multiple routes[/i] allowing for immersive-sim style of game play very often. Getting the [i]leg cyberware[/i] early really increases the verticality of the gameplay. Quests can have [i]multiple resolutions[/i] but not as complex as the Maelstrom spider-drone quest.
-[i]Radio songs and OST tracks[/i] are often memorable bangers. Too bad many in-world radios at enemy hideouts seem to play the same 4-5 songs. Combat music is different depending on the district.
-A lot of great [i]vocal performances from the English cast[/i] especially towards the end.
-[i]Multiple endings[/i] are emotionally impactful but basically let you choose at the end which one you want.
-Occasionally [i]dialogue choices[/i] are remembered and brought up again in a very natural way, sometimes much later in the story.
-[i]Quest-related NPCs[/i] go through natural poses when speaking, have unique designs and often seem 3-dimensional.
-[i]Breach minigame[/i] is well designed, fun and scales with netrunning well.
-[i]Quickhacks[/i] are effective and diverse, can be used on objects as well as enemies - a rarity in cyberpunk game.
-[i]Netrunner build[/i] is a enjoyable way to experience combat in a very different from the standard stealth FPS approach. It's entirely possible to stealthily and quickly complete entire combat-oriented gigs without ever drawing a gun.
-There is a [i]depth[/i] to the game where it doesn't openly flaunt every available car, cyberware or blueprint and it's up the player to try and find them.
-[i]Perk trees[/i] are vast and often have significant upgrades or even entirely new gameplay mechanics tucked away inside.
-[i]Loot[/i] is bound to player's level so any new equipment could be useful. If you enjoy seeing big damage numbers pop up when you shoot, it's possible to make guns that deal damage in 100k range - overkill for regular enemies. Generally the enemies are not bullet-sponges.

Overall, I completed the game twice and well into the third one, but I am out of steam mostly because the 3rd character was supposed to be a smart-gun only build, which don't work against 2 different gangs. I definitely didn't even come close to seeing 100% of what the game has to offer as I want some bug and performance updates to come out first.
Some of the issues I listed can be fixed with a lot of time. Game will also benefit from modding support.

"If you are expecting GTA but in a cyberpunk universe you are going to be disappointed.

Buggy, under-cooked, lacks polish, but the world is so captivating and well presented, as well as an incredibly good cast of characters that you genuinely will connect with.

"At the moment, launch day is a mixed feeling. Optimization is pretty bad. I've got myself a 2080, but ended up dealing with frames around 26fps at low settings. The game is indeed installed on an SSD, so I don't think that could be the cause. Character customization, not as detailed as I thought. I thought I'd end up spending hours to make a character, but it's all presets.  There's no sliders to customize how tall, how short, how buff, how skinny, etc.

So far though, Story is nice, haven't played enough to fully determine if it's good or not, but so far, the characters are quite likeable, to a certain extent, they feel human (besides some animation stiffness). They did a nice job on setting the atmosphere. Night City hit the cyberpunk aesthetics.

Driving is horrible, it feels like rear steer vehicles that are all over the place, far from realistic to the point it is better to just quick travel everywhere. Every aspect of player and vehicle AI is horrible, most of the side quests are so short, or just cut off when it starts getting good.

"Cyberpunk 2077 is a solid game, definitely fails to live up to the hype, but delivers good story with decent mechanics. I'll keep this SPOILER FREE. If you want an overview just skip to the bottom.

Lets start with the pros:

- story: 8/10 kept me hooked most of the time, NPCs felt like they were real and deep characters. However, it felt like there wasn't that many stories about them. Sure there's plenty of gigs and stuff to do, but in my opinion there needs to be more proper side quests.

- Gear: 8/10 awesome array of gear, especially the weapons, clothes are sick and the vehicles are dope as. 

- Jhonny Silverhand 10/10 game wouldn't good without him

- Skills: 7/10 it really felt like investing your points into attributes made an effective and unique character. However, it felt like investing in the tech tree was a must. Definitely better than the Witcher though.

Cons (the most important ones at least):

- glitches: obviously this is a hot topic. I'm running with a 1080ti which easily handled max graphics (obs no ray-tracing) but this didn't help with the glitches. The cosmetic ones were usually funny though they did break immersion in some important scenes. What I had real issue was when it came to several missions. In my main playthrough there was three major glitches. Two were 'fixed' by either killing myself several times and/or going back to a later MANUAL save (autosaves didn't work), however, one is yet to be fixed. It is one of the cyberpsycho missions where you need to find additional information, but it is nowhere to be seen for me....

- OP weapons: there are about 5 mega OP guns that just make the game boring, even on hard mode. The iconic katanas are also OP. This kinda made the game past ~ lvl 30 pretty lackluster and by then i was only playing for achievements and story. Obviously this can be avoided by not upgrading or crafting and/or using generic weapons but that's not a fun decision as a player to make nor is it a fair one.

- CDPR have obviously been caught up in a lot of things they said that weren't entirely true. There's one I haven't really seen people talk about much. This is a SHORT game. I lolly-gagged through this game; finished all the proper side-quests, did every mission in the Badlands and Pacifica, then finished the main-story, all that took around 55hr. CDPR said the main story itself should take around 40hrs, probably would have without OP weapons I guess... The reason I call it short is due to two things: my motto for games $X = Xhrs played and comparing to Witcher which easily has over 100hrs or play-ability.

- Night city is a ghost town, like where are the people? The CBD is busy kinda but the suburbs aren't really. Also, this is kinda a glitch but when I'm driving in the badlands or freeways I see tonnes of car lights in the distance like the road is busy but as I get closer they just disappear.

- I honestly don't see myself replaying the entire game, which is a serious problem when comes to a RPG game. Don't see any point really, yes you can choose a different background, yay different options when talking! But by ~ lvl 35 you can play any style you want anyway. I'll probs just play from the final save before the end to play the different endings. Another point to tie in is it doesn't really feel like you make any real impact on the city while you play, which may be intentional cause you cant 'tame NC' but I don't know.

- the NCPD missions are sooooooo dump. Its literally look there's baddies over there! Go kill them and loot a box/bag, good job. Even bandit camps in Skyrim at least might of had a secret or two occasionally. 

- I guess the last major thing is the map really bugs me. Like why doesn't it tell you the name of the fixers? Or the names of the Ripper Docs? It just annoying to try and remember which ones are which. You also can't see missions etc. and the boundaries of each region at the same time, seems pretty dumb to me.

Final Verdict:

All in all at first this game felt awesome, the story was engaging and the mechanics were great but as I played more I was only playing for the story. The game becomes very easy once you get some good skills and OP weapons, sneaking is easy no matter your build. The characters are great but I wish there were more (especially love interests). In the end I kinda felt like I was being railroaded a bit, similar to the last part of the Witcher 3. The glitches are mostly cosmetic but they do interfere with some missions. The game is just not long enough, especially for the price and CDPR's boasting. Finally, there's nothing really that special about this game; just a futuristic GTA with a movie star as your 'friend'.",False
"Well what can I say. CDPR dropped the ball with this one hard.
Content that was promised but not delivered and game badly optimized.
Will they try and fix all of this? Do not know. Hope so.

Game looks good when it runs with no problems and its got the right atmosphere of cyberpunk world.
There are interesting quests and NPCs just like in Witcher.
Sound, music, voice actors are all great.

Lvling and skills are good with exception when it comes to crafting specifically finding blueprints that is just pain in the ass.

Driving cars for me at least feels same as in any GTA style games - it is shit and I learned to accept it because they will never do it right in any game.

Combat can be clunky (same as in Witcher) on the beginning but when you get some skills it a little better.

When it comes to reliability by choosing different origin for character it's low and only comes in form of getting different extra conversation choices with NPCs that don't really influence the outcome of interactions through conversation with them but are there for RP purposes.
There are different outcomes with main story and some side quests depending the choices you make in conversation or how you do the quests so reliability is not completely gone but its still have nothing to do with character origin.
So I hope they will at least give us NG+ after fixing the game first.

Like I said on the beginning they dropped the ball with this one hard so for now I will leave negative review.
I will w8 and see if they will fix all of this or at least as much as they can and then maybe change it to positive.
But for all its big flaws I still enjoyed for RP and atmosphere that Night City gives.
So yes I real hope they will try and fix the game as much as they can so that in 2077 game will be breathtaking.
Sorry all. Couldn't help myself.
But seriously would be a waste to just leave it as it is.

Oh and I really hope CDPR just drops separated multiplayer plan for this game. They have more than proven that they are not ready to make it.
I really don't want another GTA online crap game full of cheaters and kids or content not promised and bugs like in single player again.

"If Steam had an option to leave a mixed review, that would be my recommendation. While I think my opinion of this game (at least in its current state) will remain the same when I finish the main quest, it's worth mentioning that I'm not done with it yet, and therefore this won't probably be my final review.

The thing is: I like this game. I love the atmosphere, the soundtrack and its general themes; heck, I even like the gunplay and the driving. But this clearly isn't the game we were waiting for. I've seen games in Early Access less buggy and unfinished than this AAA title is right now.

The sheer amount of content that was clearly cut from the release version is shocking. The AI is lacking, almost non-existent; the world is beautiful, but not at all dynamic; your actions don't have ANY consequences apart from a few scripted choices; the multiple gangs throughout the city are sadly irrelevant; your cyberwares have little effect to your gameplay apart from a few expensive ones; the roleplaying mechanics (which I thought would be at least impactful, due to the source material of this game) are less refined and interesting than the ones from multiple ""light RPGs"" that came out over the past two or three years.

I sincerely hope they patch the plentiful bugs out there and maybe add back some of the cut content, because you can clearly see the love and dedication put into this game by its devs and designers, but right now Cyberpunk 2077 is simply disappointing. It's just a shell of what it could've been, even if the quests and characters are solid and well-written.

TL;DR: For now, I would not recommend this game. It has great moments, a good story and interesting characters, but the bugs and its overall unpolished state kinda breaks the immersion and turns what could be a great experience into a chore. 7/10",False
"As the end of the wild 2020 approaches, we finally received the long awaited Cyberpunk 2077. Seven years after its announcement, we could not wait to dive into Night City and experience the future. We all had great expectations of this title but all it did was leave a sour taste in our mouths. 

With nearly 100 hours in the game, I write this review, torn between whether I should give this game a thumbs up or thumbs down. On one side, we have a game that is lacking in many ways and is far from being finished, on the other we have the software development industry that forces release of unfinished games such as this one. With this in mind, it can be hard to know who's to blame for this disaster and how to properly evaluate the situation. 

I had a lot of fun with CP2077. The first 40 hours were absolute bomb and during that time it was a game I would recommend. But not too long after the introduction, it starts to become obvious that they did not have enough time to work on the second part of the game. The quality drops greatly and you start experiencing all the bugs. They were ambitious but they overestimated their abilities. They didn't even have the time to properly test the parts they did implement, never mind make the game engaging all the way to the end. 

The Prologue was by far the best part of the game and it is clearly the part that CDPR has put most effort in. It delivers a great introduction to the story and the execution is wonderful. This takes about 10 hours to complete, and has quite steep learning curve. After that you get about 30 hours to explore the city and proceed with the MSQs before it starts to lose its magic. It becomes obvious that they had to cut out a lot of content, filling the world with generic tasks to keep the players busy instead. If they had the chance to continue working the same way they did with the prologue, I am confident that this would've been the best game ever. But that is unfortunately not how it went down. 

As of the time of writing this review, about two weeks after release, the game is quite frankly broken. We are talking Bethesda-style, if not worse. Some bugs are game-breaking, i.e. enemies seeing and hacking you through walls, quest objects not spawning and quest completion requirements not being evaluated properly, and some are less severe that break the immersion, such as falling through the world, interacting with objects only to be sent flying into the distance, your vehicle spawning under other vehicles sending them in turn flying or causing them to explode, having many instances of the same NPC in a small area, extremely dumb AI (if we can even call it that), certain items randomly appearing and disappearing from your inventory, selling an item refreshes both your and the vendor's inventory, equipping certain items gives enemies immunity, sub-par vehicle handling (especially when NPCs drive and the cars just slide around without any consideration for physics), enemies exploding when you put them down, and so on. 

I also found the crafting system quite annoying as you have to hold the craft button for some seconds to craft the item and you cannot craft in bulk, which I am sure will scare most away from this skill tree. The most disappointing, however, is the fact that the life path and dialogue options you choose make no difference whatsoever. You might gain some extra info that would've been hidden from you had you chosen a different lifepath, but the story is the exact same no matter how you choose to play. I also understand why many are disappointed in terms of the interactivity with NPCs around the City, but the way I see it, considering the technological and time limitations, the game might run like absolute shit if it would include that level of detail.  

The biggest positive, as said, is in the prologue, both gameplay and story wise, but the visuals are pretty darn good too. Night City looks amazing and driving through it never felt like a hassle; I actually found it quite fun to drive around instead of fast traveling. The character design is on point and voice acting is one of the best I've seen. Johnny Silverhand adds a nice touch to the game, making you reconsider your choices while also adding some humor to the dark story.  The first 50 hours offer plenty of fun, provided you do not have too high expectations and do not mind some bugs here and there (let's be real, most of them are hilarious). 

I really hope they will fix the game so that I can give it a thumbs up, but seeing how many issues there are, I do not expect to see the game be finished in the near future. I am afraid, however, that even once it is fixed, it will never be the game we all expected to see.

TLDR
Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that had a lot of potential and an extra year or so of work would've done wonders. However, we got a buggy mess that cannot be recommended, purely because we do not want (or shouldn't!!) encourage release of unfinished games.",False
"[h1]In Night City you can become anyone.[/h1]
And that's not a doubt. The possibilities of what you can do and who you can be are huge, and so is the world surrounding us, which definitely isn't empty. Honestly, after waiting so long for this game, I'm pretty satisfied with what we finally got.
[b]World?[/b] Night City and the surrounding area around it are very well done and it feels realistic. Each district feels different which gives the feeling, that you're not walking in the same place. You know where you are and who your enemy is.
[b]The storyline?[/b] If you're going only with main missions, it may not be so special, the side missions give quite a lot of storyline. After finishing all side missions, main missions, and even getting each ending I can say, that storyline is amazing with very good written characters.
[b]Open world activities?[/b] They're kinda the same. You just go there, kill some guys, find evidence, etc. The difference here makes gigs and cyberpsychos, especially that every single of them feels different, even if the point of the mission is the same (Steal, kill, etc.). They're good and you don't feel that they're that repetitive. 
[b]Gameplay?[/b] Typical for RPG. You gain EXP, level up skills, and give yourself some perks. The good attitude of that is that you can be whoever you want. A melee berserk, a sneaky technician, high crit gunner, whatever you like, you get it. There is not that much of a grind, at least you don't feel like you need to grind a lot of money or EXP. After doing side missions, sometimes you notice that you have enough money to buy yourself some good cybernetics. Fighting is okay and again, typical for RPG. Driving is something that feels odd at the beginning. With time you get used to cars but on the first try, you feel that cars are very heavy. Police is something that is bad in this game, could even say that very bad. The fact that they're unbalanced is one thing, but escaping them is literally just running 5 meters away. Clothes which are armor in this game, are good, different shops give different clothing style but there are no barbers or anything. Your character will look the same in the end, with no possibility to change the hair or even makeup.
[b]Technical side?[/b] Well, here my opinion is controversial. We all know that Cyberpunk 2077 has problems with bugs, some people less and some people more. I didn't get that many bugs and I can't really say that much about it. Even if some bugs are appearing, they're mostly fun bugs that don't ruin the game. The thing which definitely is buggy are cars, sometimes their textures don't load on time, but other things? Works normally or bugs are not that serious to make me even notice. AI isn't perfect, but it's not bad as well. Fact, NPC Cars are dumb and civilians sometimes act dumb as well, but the enemy AI or allies AI is good but sometimes it could be better. On High-Ultra settings, the game worked just fine on 30 FPS for me and on Medium, I had stable 60 FPS, and I don't even have that ""very spicy"" PC.
[b]OST?[/b] Oh boi... I didn't hear such an amazing soundtrack since DOOM: Eternal dropped. I can listen to it for hours, especially ""The Rebel Path"".

Is the game worth buying? It is, either on discount or full prize but because of current bugs which are problems for most players, it's better to wait until February/March 2021 with purchase, but if you don't mind bugs (or you're lucky like me to not get them that much), you can buy it right now. I give this game 9.5/10.",True
"After the Hot Fix, the game's bugs have drastically gone down and it's more than playable. There's bugs here and there but during my play through I found them to be very minor and don't take anything away from the experience. The story is entertaining, the atmosphere is great, the city is full of life, side quests are also very fun to do, and I'm overall having a very pleasant time playing Cyberpunk. If you want to wait a little longer for them to fix ALL the bugs then that's definitely a valid approach, but if you're worrying about the game being unplayable, don't be. Although its initial release was a disaster, I'd say it's definitely worth your time playing as of today.",True
"Just finished my first playtrough and i absolutely loved it.

50+ hours and I haven't really encountered any game breaking bugs. Sometimes OK you can't pickup some junk, two of my gigs where not marked complete and oh, I crashed my car into some object with 200MPH and ended up below NC which was hilarious.

The performance was better than what I expected on my old GTX 1060. I played on high in 1080p with film grain and motion blur disabled, my average fps between 30/40. This might not be enough for a lot of people these days, but I am not that demanding. For me this was doable and fine and seemed a good compromise between graphics and performance.

OK it was a bit buggy release, but most of the games are these days. Maybe they just should not have released it for older consoles, at least not in this state. It still needs some bug fixing but for me this was the best gaming experience since a long time. It has everything, good story, graphics, audio, game play, I had tons of fun.

You can go back to the “point of no return” after finishing the game, to complete side jobs, gigs, and unlock different endings. But I loved it so much I think i just go start a new game. Replay ability, another +1 for this game, there are not a lot of titles you want to play again immediately after finishing.

I think given some time, this is gonna be one of the best games this year.",True
"Cyberpunk 2077. Sure, it has it's bugs, but all in all it's a really good game! The characters are interesting and i find myself trying to look more into their backstories, the graphics are pretty good and the sound/ambiance around the city is amazing! The story is interesting and hooks you early on. Especially if you like roleplaying as your character.  

I do have some complaints though:
I can overlook all the bugs, like finding random characters T-Posing and people teleporting into a room and then gliding through walls, but the only thing that annoys me more than the bugs, is trying to drive to a quest, only to be called by some random person and have the waypoint on my map change to the location of the new quest I've just been given. The sheer number of people who call you makes it feel like you're playing GTA online, they never shut up. I don't know if this was intended or if it's a bug though, as sometimes nothing happens when I get called with a new quest.

Also, when you're doing a quest where another character is following you around, there's not much point being stealthy. If you stay out of view from cameras but your companion for the quest runs from cover, you're both spotted and then that's it. It's annoying, but luckily for me I chose not to have a stealth focused character so this doesn't affect me too much. 

I'm sure most of the bugs will be fixed in time, so I'm not worried about that. 

All in all I've really been loving this game, and if you can overlook a few bugs for the time being, I think you'd enjoy it too. 
",True
"Would not recommend in its current state. Lots of unrealized potential. Looking forward to future updates. Will gladly update the review to positive once the game is in a better state.

EDIT: While I had finished the game at the time of review, I've put in lots more hours to check out additional side-content and systems (such as crafting). The systems don't get much better (driving still feels like a chore, AI still has lots of problems, and even the skill trees and cybernetic implants feel a bit tacked on)... so the review still stands. There is a lot of game to play, but the bugs and performance issues still cause me to not recommend.

That being said, I want to be able to recommend this game and it looks as if CDPR is going to really put some time and effort into it. Hopefully it gets to the point where it is even half the game they promised, because if they do, it will be well worth it, IMO.",False
"The game seems amazing, but its clearly not ready for prime time. 

I played only 2 hours - and in those two hours encountered a slew of glitches. Horrendus texture pop in, enemy AI being dumb, NPC's clipping into geometry, the phyiscs randomly throwing objects around, populaton density being glitcy, etc. 
To top it all off, I'm pretty sure the post processing in the game is broken at some level. the world looks pretty blurry and washed out - lacking depth. There are already reshade presets that fix this - but that is no excuse.

---
Edit: Patch 1.4 fixed the TAA issue, so the game looks much crisper now (no more blur), and is easier on the eyes. There is still some weird sharpening going on, but its much, much better.

Still, the game could use customizable AA options, including supersampling.
---

The lack of any cosmetic customization features post initial creation is also super weird. In a game that has transhumanism as its primary theme, me not being able to freely customize my character - or even change my hairstyle is pretty darn bad. It all just feels so rushed, and I get the feeling this feature was cut for additional polish.
The default green tint/light in the character creator does not help either. If you pick a white hairstyle, it looks green - same with skin, and all other color sensitive options. Why did they not pick a neutral, white or warm white color for it I do not understand.

Performance was fine for me, but then again I have a top of the line PC with an nvidia 3080, so I cant really speak for the majority of people here.

Playing it in this obviously unfinished state seems like a waste.

I'd say wait before buying it - they will need a couple of months to fix all of this. It's a diamond in the rough.",False
"YES, Just yes, yes",True
"A little buggy, and i dont like how the police ""detect"" you even if you are just standing there doing nothing, pretty sure thats a bug. But other than that, love the story so far, side missions are okay, but very average. Performance is good for me on every setting to the max, including the two settings that have ""psycho"", but take that with a grain of salt, as I have an overclocked RTX 3080 and a I7-9700k overclocked to all 8 cores at 4.9ghz with DLSS on, 32gb ram, and the game is on an NVME ssd. And even still i sometimes drop to around 60fps sometimes for a game that isnt really THAT beautiful. It looks great, but not amazing, and pop in is annoying.

 I have to reiterate, the story is AMAZING, im totally loving the world that CD red have made. Also had a bug where jackie dissapeared after visiting Victor the ripper doc for the first time, not allowing me to progress, but by just saving and loading that same save, it solved itself. Also, I dont think im a noob, but V dies reeeeally easily, was playing on hard and then medium and still would die really fast after the 5 hour point, which is a shame because i want to use my katana and then the mantis blades eventually, so i had to lower the difficulty to easy, but maybe i just specced my char incorrectly. Side missions are kiiiinda boring/lackluster so far though, and seems like a lot of filler content to just clear out enemies every other damn block.

 It might be buggy but im glad i can play now, if you have a problem with it just wait, but there are those of us who wanted this months ago, and personally id rather have a few bugs but get it in my hand sooner. If you have an amd card, you should probably wait until the next gen console update comes out, and since those use amd gpus, im sure cd red will try and optimize it more. If youre team green though, hop in and immerse yourself into an awesome world! Also, zero crashes so far.",True
not good,False
"Open world feels lacking, and empty.... Story line is good. NPCs will spawn willfully anywhere. I can’t believe they released this mess of a game in this state. The foundations are strong for a game I believe could be a gta 5 but it will take some time completely reprograming many areas. Shame on you CD for releasing this without being honest. (You knew about this and now you’re a MEME) I once thought you would be that underdog who would show EA, and companies like that how it’s done. You have lost your way my friend and have lost my trust. Good luck earning that back",True
"Until optimization is improved I'll keep this negative review. Cmon, 1060 can get me only 40 fps on lowest settings 1080?",False
"After 109 hours I can say with confidence that I am very bored. I'm not sure what I'm bored with, but I still haven't finished the story. That's not because the game is too long, I finished Witcher 3 and expansions twice, it's just that I don't care to finish it at this time. V is not interesting to me and the game's prologue does more harm than good. Judy [spoiler]does become a bigger presence in V's life, even if you're not romancing her and I genuinely like her as a friend[/spoiler], but I dislike the voice over for Panam, so I've actively avoided her nagging missions. I don't give a flying fuck whether she [spoiler]ditches or joins the Aldecaldos[/spoiler] and that is my Nomad opinion, man. A Forbes online gaming journo named Panam as the game's best character, so maybe I haven't gotten far enough with her. [spoiler]I sure as hell don't care to romance her, never mind my gender or our respective sexual orientations. I would like to romance both River Ward and Judy Alvarez[/spoiler] as a male V, but since [spoiler]he's straight and she's gay[/spoiler], I will have to do with [spoiler]Johnny Silverhand's former bandmate[/spoiler] that seems to have the same hair as my character. Too close to reality this game, you fall for the ones who swing the other way even if you swing both ways.

Cyberpunk's economy is a mystery to me. Here you have vehicles, weapons and cyberware that can cost as high as several hundred thousand eddies, slang for the eurodollar currency. Then it gives you a ridiculously small carry capacity even after a perk, attribute points in Body, clothing mods and temporary capacity boosters. Drop points may or may not be close when your capacity is full, but their vicinity doesn't matter to me, it's the activity itself that annoys me. Most of the guides I've seen have recommended dismantling all unnecessary items for crafting components, either selling them as is or crafting hundreds of the same type of item that make the biggest profit. I most definitely didn't spend as much time doing that in Witcher 3, even though crafting all of the armour and weapon sets to Grandmaster level is an expensive pastime. Also, you can sell all weapons and clothing that cost between, say, 800-3000 eddies and do lots of repetitive NCPD scanner hustles for loadsamoney. Hacking access points is also a good way to make a lot of money, if you get the necessary perks. So when you're not in the mood for story, the core gameplay is the act of chasing the almighty dollar to afford a bunch of cool stuff. Too close to reality this game, you work your butt off in order to afford the next iBauble to increase your imaginary social status.

My focus in Witcher 3 wasn't to make money so that I can afford a bunch of cool stuff, it was to experience an absolutely epic story. In Cyberpunk's case all of the RPG stuff comes in the way of that, at least for me. For some odd reason I associate the first-person view coupled with guns with a typical single player shooter experience, but not so in the case of Skyrim with its swords and sandals or even Dark Messiah of Might and Magic. Imagine being able to switch between first and third-person views here like in GTA V, it would benefit the game immensely in terms of its RPG aspects, but the game is designed to only accommodate it for vehicles. Why this unwavering selective double standard?

Who doesn't love Keanu Reeves? I do, you probably do, but not even his devilish charms got his hooks into me to finish the story, for now. I don't mean to only talk ill of Cyberpunk, many things about it are awesome, from the shooting and the cyberware abilities to some exemplary main and side missions. None of it seems to have any lasting effect though. CDPR's dedication to detail and believability is on point as always, but then they put underwear on me even though I'm completely nude in front of a mirror? Wasn't this a game for adults? Not close enough to real life if you ask me. It's also a game that blends genres better than most, but since it was rushed to be released, some of those genre aspects or minute-to-large design choices come off as half-assed or superficial. Too much hype is a bad thing and clearly no developer is infallible now that CDPR has been knocked down a peg or two. I will most likely start a new game at some point, now that I have a better understanding how not to waste my time and lower my expectations for however the story pans out. The game's overstated lifepath choice seems mostly inconsequential aside from small dialogue choices. I most definitely expected several Nomad missions outside of Night City well before I was freed from the lockdown in Watson. To hell with prologues. Lots of detail blurred by standard video-gamey stuff we've seen time and time again. Watson doesn't overwhelm you, but I picked Nomad and got sent straight to Night City. A wasted opportunity if you ask me, which sums up this entire release.",True
"The game play is extremely boring, weak, and repetitive. Driving mechanics are horrific. AI behaviour is preschool level. The combat is beyond redemption. There is absolutely nothing about this game worth buying it at full price. I find myself booting it up only to play for 15 minutes and remember why I stopped playing in the first place: it's a horrible, unoptimized, bug-filled mess with literally NOTHING fun or interesting to do.",False
"Runs like utter garbage even on the lowest possible settings. The game seems fun, but it's mostly unplayable due to the horrible graphics optimization and the amount of bugs. A 1080 ti and i5 8600K has no problem playing other AAA games; the minimum requirements they tout are completely dishonest.

After playing through the entire story, getting to level 40, and grinding side gigs, I can say for fact that this game is a boring and generic FPS. No matter what choices you pick, you will always end up going on the same path as everyone else. Definitely not worth $60.",False

"okay, so quick redo after completing the game:

- game has gameplay that isn`t bad and can even be enjoyable at the moments;
- game has troubles with ""open-world"" features when you compare it to GTAV or RDRII;
- game is still riddled with bugs, and not only visual ones.. but


+ game has A METRIC FCKTON of content to sift through, the city is worked down to minute details;
+ game has AMAZING sidestories, with enjoyable and interesting characters and engaging plotlines (and they have consequences, too! maybe not THAT non-linear how someone had imagined it should`ve been, but it is non-linear in some ways nonetheless);
+ and, the last but definetly not least, is the fact that the game has a story that just lifts this whole clusterfuck of rushed release, and CHUCKS it waay up the quality cliff. the story is.. not unique in its separate parts, as no story is unique, but, when assembled together, those parts convey a vision, a believable world, a legend about someone named V. and it is an adventure that will stay with you, like a digital construct jammed into back of your head.

In my opinion, the game is worth its money. Sadly, still not worth its hype tho.. hope it will grow in the future.

"Where to even begin after 8 years of development with nonstop hype, like it will change the gaming industry forever, fix broken relationship, bring some thing new to the table in RPG genre it failed in every aspect sadly. Blind CD project fanboys , or anyone praising this game like this is some greatest game in human history and giving it 10/10, 9/10, or even 8 are just straight up delusional. How anyone justify this buggy, glitchy , unpolished mess is beyond me. 
  This games problem goes much deeper than just performance issues:
 The gunplay is terrible and  absolute bullet sponge, if you want to kill someone better finish the  whole magazine unless you got some special burning effect or  electric effect guns, The NPCS in this game are absolute joke they dont even run when the gun is pointed at them , the police/wanted system is useless if you kill some one police will spawn behind you out of nowhere , and the wanted system will activate but you can easily break past them by just driving the car easily or just simply running away thats it , not to mention the NPCS are not even say thank you for saving them from the bad guys and they will stuck with same exact pose like they are about to be executed.
Now for the story it somewhat ok at best not anything new or groundbreaking either , it is edgy just for the sake of it.Whatever some few important moments the story has to offer it got ruined by T-POSE, important people got stuck in weapon holster and equip loop. I dont know what happened to the phrase ""coming when its ready"", after 8 years of development ,spending 3 to 4 months in tweeter making fun of other companies they just released a unfinished , buggy garbage and we became the beta testers. This aint nothing but a overhyped overmarketed scam.
The thing is i dont want to hate the game thats why i preordered in the first place .They promised so much thing in the trailer about so many customization and how picking a different class will shape your ending but guess what there was nothing the outcome is same in the end , you cant even get a haircut in this game.Cyberpunk 2077 is the best sequel to the legendery masterpiece fallout 76 , a true beauty indeed.",False

Cyberpunk 2077 is nothing special. The game play feels like if Deus Ex and Fallout 4 were merged into one. With it's clunky shooting, sub-par stealth, ugly melee, ugly graphics and just mediocre story in general. If it wasn't for Reeves being in this game, and developed by an already overrated company, this game wouldn't have had the praise it currently does, now.

This game spent 8 years in development, but clearly needed another 88 in the oven. Despite having the specs to play this smoothly, I feel like I am playing this on my kindle. The rendering in it is so slow, it has lead to some rather humourous moments. One of them being when the dago drives you across a bridge, only for him to suddenly stop and started talking to himself; thinking I was watching a scene from Fight club, it turns out no one had loaded in yet. I am glad I am not the only one to have had these issues, even on computers that are far powerful than mine.

This game justifies the Molotov-Ribbentrof pact. Only a congregation of split-jawed mutants could have made this in 8 years. Another thing, the forum on this game is a joke.

"Cyberpunk 2077 takes place in a future ristic Dark World with fun and enganging combat, story changing player choices and side quest and Character development. In 2077 an economic crisis and nuclear conflict has left America in pieces with most of the world degenerading into lawless war zones everybody from everywhere around the world converged in the overcrowding Night City a hub with the most resources and  home of cutting edge technology. Night City continues to offer the promise of a civilized future. But in the streets a struggle for power rages: Gangs, Corpo agents, Politicians and all manner of criminals strive to outplay one another while civillans get caught in the cross fire. 

Night City ""the city of dreams"" where my story with V takes place is filled with crime, people from different cultures live and are govern by the Rich and heavily armed with weapons and latest cyberware who are the different Coporeations. From the Rich Fixer that looks like he is some rich dude from Las Vegas that has made it big that he hires Mercenary to do whatever he wants to the Japanese Yakuza and to other Corpo agents gazing from thir glass towers at the City Center at their money making ""Casino"" in the city which is their dominion. Night City is just like a Casino where everyday everybody gamble their lives with and just like every Casino you gamble in the house always wins. Just like what the protagonist V says "" Even if you come in and become a star there is no garuntee of you making it out alive"" 

Every part of Night City is fully detailed like no other,  the streets are filled with so much detail that I just want to spend hours and explore every part of it even while though i am just in the early stages of the story. You have to navigate the streets, the walkways you need to move through the city on its terms and you will enventually come to know its landmarks and the best way to move between them.  It also helps that Cyberpunk 2077' s map is large enough but not too large to make you travel for 30 mins to a new area. The map isn't just big in that typical open world game sense where other games such as Assassins Creed would try to stretch the map as large and as wide as possible to make it feel large, the map isn't mean to be super large but its meant to be memorable. Cyberpunk 2077 makes the world feel alive and large with the way the world is built: Its not as large as what you would see from other open world games however the Tall Copo buildings such as Arasaka's HQ to the building V lives in to the smaller places such as the streets of Japan town makes you and tells you how small in this world you actually are, no other game that i have played has look as beautiful as Night City and every day i just can't wait to get back into the game regardless of whether I am intending to just explore or continue with the main story Never before i have ever live in a City so beautiful never before have i ever live in a City that feels so alive. No matter what short comings the game has, Night City is always there. It is as if i was diving into a World and living the life of the Mercenary V

Walking the streets of Night City is one of the most fun things you can do, observing its people and hearing the chit chat of corrupted cops taking bribes from gangs to do their bussiness to hearing a pair of gangsters threatening a street hawker to girls and guys offering you a ""service"" in a room for some money or disagreements that end up getting out of hand not to mention the Neon sex Ads and seeing the news on the screens in the city talking about other world events or happenings in Night City while driving and walking along the streets, the constant gang wars and crime You will be driving along and you will hear rival gangs throwing down or having a shoot out with the cops. These things are vital as they bring a lot of life to Night City and make the game feel so alive playing a part in the overall experience. 

Apart from just looks, One of the things that stands out the most from Cyberpunk 2077 atmosphere has to be the different cultures and Gangs living in Night City: The poeple living in the street just trying to make it through each day to The Japanese Yakuza and other asian minorities in Little China and Japan town, the unpredictable Maelstrom gang who are obssesed with Cyber Implants, the LGBT and Bi-sexual also known as the Mox, the good old All American Gang also known as Sixth Street, the Mexicans from the Valentinos or the Hacian Vodoo boys living in the under funded and abandnoned Pacifica who was once a promised of capital to the Badlands in the Desert. Taking each and every part of Night City isnt just about seeing how good it looks but also to see how each sub culture lives from fashion, architecture, advertisments, people, poverty and health.

Cyberpunk 2077 main story is hard hitting at times emotionally, the story writing does a really good job at playing with your emotions. In the Main Story, You end up with a brain tumor also known as the chip that contain the memories of Johnny Sliverhand. Johnny Sliverhand is a guy who use to host rock concerts and pull out his Pistol and shoot Corpo agents who are there, have sex with 3 other women while he has a girlfriend before he died and he is pissed off at the Corpo Organization he use to fight against. What you choose to do will affect the people areound you and your relationship with him and it can shape your story and affect its ending. Johnny Sliverhand shows up time to time during Main Quest, side quest and sometimes when you are doing your own thing. The Main Story isn't as meaty and as long as other open world games which is good because that means i won't get burn out from playing the main campaing while doing side stuff.

What stood out to me the most however was the Side Quest as they usually have really interesting events, deep storyline and they connect you with a unforgettable cast of characters. Cyberpunk feels unique because its side quest is the best content and it feels different from the main story these are not side quest that drag you to extend your playtime like other open world games such as Assassins Creed but they are built upon the choices you choose to make and they open up totally new endings to your story, they don't just make a small difference but a massive difference in endings and they are avaliable to you as long as you are willing to spend time with them, getting to know them, or should you choose going into a relationship with them. This Side quest are confonting, emotional and fun just like the ones from The Witcher 3. The legacy of this game will owe a lot to these optional SIde Quest. The pacing and Delivery of the side quest is one of the most innovative aspect of Cyberpunk as they unfold so unexpectedly as you wait for a phone call or message. 
You can be planning to buy a new car and suddenly the best girl in the game calls you and wants to meet, your plans suddenly change and you spend the next hour or so not knowing it was coming up as you never planned for it. You can't plan or prepare what Cyberpunk throws at you and where other open world games will show it to you with a quest line or on the map to spoil the experience. The way Cyberpunk handles side quest which other open world games don't do is something i really respect. 

Verdict: 
Cyberpunk 2077 is a Master piece, once again CD Project Red has delivered what they promised, The best looking game, one of the best RPG, one of the Best FPS but most importantly one of the best story telling game Sure, the optimization issues are annoying But it is something that i don't want to stop playing because I love every aspect of the game and I love the universe it’s set in. This game is not a next generation leap but a evolution of Open World games it sets a completly new standard to open world games that nobody has managed to be able to do and sets a completly new standard to open world games.",True

"DISCLAIMER: I am running Cyberpunk 2077 on a high-spec gaming PC with an AMD Ryzen 9 5950x and an RTX 3070 Vision all on high/ultra settings on a 1080p TV, so please take that into consideration when reading my review. I realize not everybody is having nearly the same experience, but my thoughts in this review can only apply to my own personal experience and nobody else's. 

OVERALL RATING: 10/10 Will definitely be playing this game for the foreseeable future. With that said.......

If you're here for a realistic open-world, ""true-to-life"" simulator, then look elsewhere. 

If you're here expecting a 100% masterpiece, you are only setting yourself up for disappointment. I'd suggest only people with the latest hardware will have anything close to that kind of experience, and even then, for all I like about this game, there is more than enough holding it back from being that (at least in it's current state). Give it about a year to fix bugs, apply patches and add DLC and then I will be happy to update this review. 

If you're a seasoned gamer with a newer Xbox Series X, PS4 Pro, PS5, or gaming PC with at least a GTX 1060 or higher, and you can look past the bugs (and maybe a crash or a glitch every now and again), then in my opinion, this is an outstanding and incredible story-driven game. 

Granted, the reviews (and seemingly everybody and their own mother) out there may be screeching otherwise to anybody and everybody they possibly can. But for me personally? I have now spent about 80 hours after having finished playing one of the main story endings from my Nomad Lifepath/Stealthy Netrunner playthrough (which I loved) and am now just going around Night City exploring different random events that I happen across. Every time I did one of these so-called ""random events"" (ala one of the fixers calling me on my cell phone), I stop what I'm doing and just go do that new gig. I have been taking a stealthy, slow and measured approach to the gameplay and am taking extra time to read absolutely everything I come across to get a deeper look at each individual situation I find myself in, regardless of what it is. Most/all of them had some type of world-building or small addition to the story that either felt impactful in meaningful way or taught me more about the world these characters live in. In my own humble opinion, If you have some type of next-gen console and/or a good PC gaming machine, and you can appreciate extremely detailed stories, rich lore and great world-building, this is the fucking game for you. 

Yes, the game is broken and there's a ton of cut content. Yes, the higher-ups at CPDR screwed both themselves and their own devs into a stupid situation by releasing this game well before they should have. And you know what else? 

I don't give one, single, dandelion of a lone, solitary f***. 

Just from playing this game these past few days, I was able to see the unbridled passion the devs at CPDR have put into this cut-content mess of a game. And every time I play this game, even with all the glitchy supposedly game-breaking bugs I have found (and believe me, that number wasn't always insignificant), I somehow always found myself smiling whenever I was just playing this game and enjoying it for what it is:

A game where I get to have fun; nothing more, nothing less.

The music (*chef's kiss*). The complex scenery. The huge city. The sheer level of detail on every part no matter how small or even seemingly insignificant. All my character interactions with the story characters. The kickass guns. The awesome action. The quiet character moments. All of this was well worth the $60 price tag in my opinion. I know CDPR is now in some legal trouble and the roads ahead don't look so great right now from the outside looking in. But this is not the type of world you can create without having amazing people who care about their game. The world of Cyberpunk 2077 is an achievement the devs at CDPR should be damn proud of for having had a part in creating it.

This is just some random Steam review from a random gamer you will likely gloss over, and I don't blame you or anybody for that (I mean, who really cares about one random guy's opinion on the internet anyway, I mean really?). But let me tell you this: I don't play games all that often anymore. Life has gotten busy and I have adult responsibilities that don't afford me a lot of time to enjoy games as much as I used to. Not saying I live a sad life or anything like that, but if anything, time I've spent developing my life personally and professionally has just made them seem like a smaller priority and a lot less important to my life in retrospect. But this beautiful and amazing game is just the latest example in a long line of many reasons why I always make a little bit of time in my life to get some quality gaming done. 

So yea, I don't care how broken it is right now OR how much of a hate-boner everybody and their mother on Twitter and Rock Paper Shotgun seems to have for this game. I'm loving my time in Night City, and I'm gonna keep playing this game because I fucking love it. In fact, I probably won't stop playing unless I finally get tired of it. But spoiler-alert: That probably ain't gonna happen anytime soon.

TL;DR This game is absolutely broken in a lot of ways. But this is also the absolute best, broken, content-cut mess of a game I have ever had the pleasure of playing, and I think you should play it too. 

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.",True

I don't write reviews. However, I am in utter shock and disappointment.

"Honestly, the game is super fun and the hours Ive put into the game was from one massive bender.

None of the bugs I experienced in my time were game breaking (despite being really, REALLY annoying). Im holding off on playing it any further and pretending it went on another 2-3 month delay. I recommend you do the same if you havent bought the game already to see if CDPR will have a lot of the bugs hammered out",False

What a scam, trash can game.",False
"The witcher 3 is one of the best game I've ever played so I was thoroughly looking forward to this game (like the rest of the world). I did really try to give it a chance despite all the negative reviews...however I would not reccomend this game even after the glitches are fixed. I say this after I beat the game multiple times through different lifepaths and did numerous side quests. 

Pros:
-The design of the entire game (world, cars, characters, etc.)
-Voice acting of all the characters
-Soundtrack
-Keanu Reeves/Johnny Silverhand

Cons:
-Glitches (enough said)
-Story is only 20 hours long which is far too short for an $80 game
-The combat and movement is clunky
-Phonecall system interrupts you during missions and other character conversations (no way to decline calls)
-Too many text messages that are frustrating to check
-The menus are slow and way too cumbersome to navigate 
-Characters frequently talk over each other during important scenes
-No auto drive feature/driving controls + physics are poorly done
-Delamain missions will constantly interrupt you if you do not finish them anytime you get within a few KM
-NPCs are brutal, they seem lifeless 
-The chip malfunction sequences last for too long
-The menu music loudly beeps every 10ish seconds you are in the menu
-No option for 3rd person (give us the choice and let us play how we would like to)
-The missions, menus, combat, etc. is all very generic and nothing new was tried (e.g. Ghost of Tsushima lets the wind guide you to objectives instead of waypoints). Cyberpunk insisted it would be the most innovative game ever but did not try really anything new.
-Incoming quests automatically activate and replace the current quest you are in the middle of
-The overheating system in combat was bad, I would get overheated from enemies on different floors
-V's apartment is pointless, you are there twice the entire game
-Quests do not show off the world lore or city very much
-No context on world (the witcher 3 walked you through the story so well you did not even have to play the first 2 games or read the books). In cyberpunk I felt like there was this really cool backstory that never got explained properly.
-V becoming a legend as a story focus seems forced when they only thing we did was attack Arasaka tower (which Johnny and his friends had done twice before)...it felt like all the missions and quests beforehand were irrelevant. How exactly is V a legend when we've done nothing noteworthy besides small quests?
-The map is beautiful but small and not as vertical as the developers promised...much of the map is window dressing and inaccessible. 
-The game says it is an RPG but the choices you make in the game don't really change anything. There are a few different endings but this game feels like the developers are forcing down the story they created and the player makes no impact at all besides being along for the ride. It feels more like an interactive movie then it does an RPG

Hope this helps! If the game is on sale for like $20 and the upcoming DLC makes some aspects more interesting I might say give it a chance because there IS a lot of potential for it to be a good game. However, I would say this game is mediocre at best- 6/10

8 years in the making to have small peepee or big peepee,True
"It saddens me to say this, but CP 2077 isn't what a majority of us (arguably) had hoped for. A few pointers: 

- Lifepath choices are extremely superficial

Each path's introduction takes around 20 minutes to complete, after which you're awarded a cutscene that jumps you forward in time. This game essentially tells you to care about a handful of characters, which you have met literally 3 minutes earlier. Depending on how you play the game, those same characters also disappear shortly after and the game REALLY wants you to care, and V probably does - but you, the player, are left thinking ""I just met you guys lol"".

- AI is pretty much non-existent 

The AI is just underwhelming outside of scripted events during missions. Police NPCs spawn 2 ft behind the player, but never give chase beyond a block, nevermind following by car. Traffic will forever be stuck if anything's in their path, say the player vehicle - like you literally cannot park your car remotely within the lane, otherwise there will be a traffic jam. AI warps in & out of existence and AIs generally don't have a night/day cycle, where they tend to some sort of rudimentary agenda. If you enter any of the set pieces spread out through the city, e.g. one of the numerous police crime scenes, the law will simply open fire. If you save a person from imminent death or being robbed, they remain in a cowering fear position.

Make no mistake, as far as open world and combat AI goes, even Ubisoft does a (sadly) much more convincing job of delivering an immersive open world experience.

- Player choice is not only just an illusion, but a rare one at that

You don't get to decide much, change the outcome of quests and the likes. V is a predetermined character, and a fairly bland one at that. CDPR would have probably been better off to just go with a set-in-stone character and introduction, perhaps that way V would be less generic as a main character.

This is probably my biggest issue with the game. It was touted as a REAL RPG, a ""your V"" type of experience. It really isn't though. It's much closer to being a linear FPS shooter, with some dialogue options for flair and an open world that's about as complex as it was in driver 2 on Playstation 1 - albeit much more beautiful.

- Gear & loot system is ridiculous 

You're literally picking up a dozen guns/armor pieces after every fight, which there are a LOT of. Essentially, you're going to end up replacing your entire gear every 5-30 minutes depending on where you're at and how you're playing. Crafting is in the game, but you have to invest into the ability in order to craft worthwhile gear. Begs the question why you would do that, if equal loot is p. much around every corner.

It's also silly that either crafting or making sacrifices stats-wise is required of you, as to not look like a complete clown.



All in all, CP 2077 is NOT what it was hyped up to be. Not in terms of content nor performance. Then there's this really (surprising) shady manner in which the game was released in this clearly unfinished, and at least on consoles, broken state, and it really begs the question: ""How many times have they started from scratch?""

Because you simply cannot tell me, that they were 8 years into the game, pushed the release back every now and then, even as recent as 2 months back, and then went ""Alright, this is good.""  Like, with all that's missing and broken, from AI, to character customization, laughably short and inconsequential Life Paths, bugs, glitches - like get this: Your character doesn't even have a reflection. Every other NPC does, but yours does not. Then turn on Photo mode while standing in front of a reflecting surface and you'll see that you now have a reflection... but your character has no face lol. Also, I'd advise against paying attention to your shadow while moving/fighting, it highlights ALL kinds of fucked up animations.

Photo mode in general, while pretty, really only serves to highlight how rudimentary V's character model is. Snap a picture while performing ANY significant action and it's only 1st person. Then take a pic, while jogging or walking, and you'll see that there's no correlation with what's actually going on in game. It's just a prepared still of an exaggerated SIMS like strut and stupid shit like that.


With that out of the way, is CP 2077 a terrible game? No. When it works, it's a fairly decent game. But no more than that, unfortunately. It actually reminds me a lot of those games from the developer team ""Spiders"", namely Technomancer, Mars: War Logs etc. In the sense that you can tell that the initial concept was great and the will was there, but the execution was awful. Obviously CP 2077's a much larger scale game and has a few more upsides.

What's to enjoy:

- Voice acting is good
- The main quest is at times very cinematic
- Approach most situations however you like, be that through the door, window, and stealth or guns blazing. 
- Driving itself I enjoy (controversial. personally I just like the weight behind cars and the deliberate steering)
- The city's really nice to look at
- Lots of content

If you can get past the bugs, and you have limited/no expectations as far as CP 2077 coming close to what it was advertised as, but you enjoy cinematic open world shooters? Go for it.",False
"Sadly there are to many things really annoying me about this game.
I love the city, the story(so far), the gameplay overall, but there is smth about this game, that really makes me ask myself ""WHY""?

""Why can't I change my characters appearance anymore, neither the face nor the hairstyle? Isn't a plastic surgery or a barber a thing anymore in 2077?
Why couldn't you even tell in the character-creation right at the beginning? Do I really need to start a new savegame just because I want to change my hairstyle, srsly?

Why is the interface such a mess and unintuitive?

Why are there so many bugs and glitches after the game was in development for 8 years?

Why isn't it possible to walk on Mouse+Keyboard?

Why do the vehicles in the game feel so terrible to drive?

Why is 3rd person not-immersive? Many games are, yet still very immersive, why can't the player decide himself?.

Why are so many keys not rebindable?

Why can I quicksave but not quickload? I see quicksave is more important but that doesn't make quickload completely unnecessary""

These things really made my immersion go ""BOOM"". CD used to say ""first person is so immersive"", how can you tell if the game overall is immersionbreaking? You missed the spot, did awesome mechanics and created a breathtaking world, but just missed the keyfeatures for a perfect game.
I really hope these things will be fixed in the near future. I can live beeing stuck on first person tho, yet many people don't. But I would really prefer a 3rd Person view at least as an option. So many players just don't buy this game due to this restriction and missing out an potentially amazing experience, just think about it at least.",False

"A huge disappointment. Not only is the game a buggy mess, reminiscent of Bethesda at their worse, the actual game is not very good. Despite claiming to be an RPG, the game has little to no actual RPG mechanics. The character customisation is incredibly limited, the choices don't do anything, and world feels incredibly bland, with the majority of the ""content"" being nothing more than meaningless combat. The game feels more like a Ubisoft looter-shooter than an RPG, much more Farcry than Fallout. In fact, make the entire game online and it'd be no different than one of EA's ""Live Service"" games. The game was announced 8 years ago and it still feels rushed and aimless. However, the most annoying thing (for a fan of Cyberpunk 2020 at least) is that despite having loads of great lore and backstory, they still decided to rewrite the original and made it a lot worse.

Verdict: Play AC: Odyssey instead. It's also an action-adventure with shallow RPG mechanics but at least it doesn't lie about it.",False

Я считаю, что все проблемы технической части исправятся со временем, пусть даже через полгода, главное что игра в памяти останется благодаря сильным сторонам, потому что они бесспорно перевешивают недостатки. Даже почти бесполезная прокачка, имбаланс ближнего боя и убогий стелс не портят впечатления, не искажают тех эмоций, которые получаешь во время прохождения, погружения в историю.

"EDIT 1:
For those that don't wanna read:
This game runs a LOT better then i expected on the hardware i have right now (Video's below)
(Especially compared to games like Jedi: Fallen Order and Shadow of the Tomb Raider)

EDIT 2:

Gameplay and Storyline wise the game seems fine to me, but i have not played it long and solid enough to form a real proper opinion
I've heard there's a lot of glitches and bugs in the game but i've only seen 1 myself (an item i couldnt pick up)
But personally, i think those should be too much of an issue, if they are too gamebreaking CDPR will most likely fix them.

EDIT 3:

After playing it for 6 and a half hours last night i can say i am totally loving the game, i did encounter a few bugs but nothing gamebreaking
An NPC sticking their own Gun through their head and a Car that disappears leaving the driver in mid-air for a bit before that too was gone xD
Best bug had to be my car driving through the air and walls after being summoned

=============

Got the game as a Bday present, decided to see how my PC would perform with this game.

I am SHOCKED at how proper it runs compared to Jedi: Fallen Ordrer and Shadow of the Tomb Raider
Fallen Order's FPS is ALL OVER THE PLACE (not in a good way) and SotTR's FPS dropped to below 25 for me on the LOWEST SETTINGS in a few locations

This game, running at MAX settings had me looking at a pretty decent FPS while running through one of the busiest places i could find

Please note that I was not going for a stable FPS, i just wanted to see how the game performed on my PC

EDIT:
For those that are still on Windows 7:
Windows 7 handles this game like a champ, BUT after testing i can say Windows 10 handles it a lot better!
I tried the same thing with Ray Trace ULTRA on W7 and the game's FPS tanked before my entire PC locked up XD
Windows 7 can run the game pretty ok for me at Medium/High settings, but for the better/best experience Windows 10 is kind of needed (I hate to say this :P)

"[b] After beating the game [/b]
Story and world are the strong points. Combat is okay. AI is a fucking joke. Civilians and cars move on rails, not actually driving or having any sort of plan. There isn't parking lots, can't interact with non-marked stores, no eating or drinking animations, [b] police literally appear out of thin air behind you when wanted and don't chase you, if you accidently run over a person or two you get pretty much insta-killed by drone police [/b]. There is a good world in this game that maybe the devs can save if they take the No Man's Sky route. But it's a damn fucking shame CDPR forced the game out in this state. Ironic - a game that shits on corporations fucks over itself by caring about money and not quality. Wait a couple of months, and see if they actually deliver basic game mechanics.
TLDR; Great game, there are a few things that seem to have been misrepresented or missing like aspects of character customization. There is lack-luster performance and a plethora of visual bugs that I shouldn't have to deal with after 3 delays. Coming patches should turn an otherwise great game into a fantastic one, and CDPR currently has a track record of being good with improving the games they release. Current state: 8/10, unless you have a great computer, wait for patches. 

[b] My critiques [/b]

If you were expecting Cyberpunk 2077 and not GTA 5 + COD + Forza and whatever else, game is really, really good.
No game is going to perfectly emulate life, so please don't play any game expecting it too.
 I like the game, but that's only because my ability to actually play is passable with my cutting edge computer. For the average person, performance is gonna be mediocre at best. I have already had 4 CTDs. 



Optimization is not what it should be. Way more bugs than there should be, especially with 3 delays. Character customization (cosmetics) is not what I expected, and might be a case for 'false advertising'. Don't like that there aren't any barbershops, tattoo parlors, etc and that so far I haven't found a way to wear clothes as costumes and not for stats. PC movement needs a binding to walk. Breaks immersion to be speed walking around when in quests, or just looking down at your legs when going down the side walk for a scroll. NPC movement and driving overly rigid and looks weird. Cars need more visual destruction when hitting things (GTA does this well. Don't want to compare the games, but this is something I'd expect CDPR to have put in). Cars also destroy posts and rails like they are cardboard. Raytracing makes really weird lighting on characters eyes in cars when you are in a tunnel, the whites of their eyes glow brightly (playing on latest drivers, 3080, 5600x, 64 gb ram). Enemies should be a little less bullet-spongy (at the game progressed this got better though, not sure if its stronger guns or perks, or the combination). Audio mixing and cutoff is weird, sound randomly cuts off as you round a corner instead of getting quieter,  and radio music volume is inconsistent in the world and needs to be louder in the car. Stealth alerting is kinda weird, where as soon as you are detected enemies are all immediately alerted without a callout (although enemies are connected through networks, so attacking someone and their friends knowing makes sense lorewise, but then why don't they notice when someone is knocked out? Either be consistent for gameplay or for lore, CDPR). That being said, most gripes I have with the game should be patchable. 

[b] What is good? [/b]

The world, when not experiencing visual bugs or weird pop-in/out looks amazing. Characters are really detailed, and facial and body language is incredible, really feels immersive when game isn't breaking. Guns feel good, sound and music designs on their own is great, and both story and how your  decisions impact characters and your path are excellent. Keanu is cool.",False
"[h1]TL;DR - GOTY[/h1]  Despite all the jank, this is my 2020 game of the year.



[h1]Here, there be Jank [/h1]
As of December 2020...  There are some graphical glitches and rough edges.   My male appendage sticks through my pants.  lolol

You can't remap some keys e.g., ESDF movement, in game.  You can do it manually by editing the xml file with a text editor that allows find/replace.    I would have thought key mapping would be bog standard in this day and age.  I guess not.


[h1]It Was the Best of Times; It Was the Worst of Times [/h1]
If you can get past the jank, the game is pretty darn good.   

The engrossing main story (and it's presentation) is one of the best of any game I have played.   The epilogues after the ending, which varies based on your choices, are awe inspiring.

The implants, weapons, and hacking are all very cool.  The city is very well realized.  The hyper violence and sexuality creates a vision of a very dark future.  This is the best realization of cyberpunk I have ever seen in any medium.

It is not all roses however...

The NPCs are dumber than a box of rocks.  GTA V sets a very high bar for random NPCs that this game does not come close to matching.  How long ago did GTA V come out?    

There are also some glaring omissions, like not being able to change your hair, make up, or anything else related to your looks except your clothes.  There are no barbers in this dark future apparently.",True

"I cannot recommend this game in it's current state, it's been rushed and everyone can see this. The graphics look nowhere close to the screenshots on the store page or the trailers, the AI is dumb as rocks, compared to the AI from RDR2 or even Fallout 4, it cannot think for itself at all, it just stays in place, plays an animation and spews random lines of dialogue not reacting to anything.

In the first couple of hours I've had numerous bugs, from NPCs T-posing to graphical glitches, items floating, NPCs spawning inside eachother, falling trough the map, not being able to pick up items, scanner mode turned stuck turned on without being able to deactivate it, being launched in the sky while riding bikes and the list goes on ...

Some examples are the ability to use your wire to hack people (https://youtu.be/vjF9GgrY9c0?t=2540), hacking reveales information about the network, more interesting viruses to upload, more loot from hacked devices. DISCLAIMER: the changes here may be due entirely to balace issues and/or making the game better and more intuitive. I keep this as a promise ""half kept"" as the hacking system gets really boring really soon and doesn't even many abilities you can upgrade.

- Strong RPG elements (https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-is-a-much-deeper-roleplaying-experience-than-the-witcher-3-says-dev/). This was actually subject of lengthy debates in this thread, as some of you are happy with the ""RPGness"" of CP2077. Personally I have not seen a lot of elements that make a game an RPG, such as relevant checks (speech, perception... right now all we have are options to break a door or go around it), solid companions, defined power dynamics between factions and a general sense of progression achieved through meaningful upgrade to your character. The game right now is more akin to a shooter/looter with stats. Which is not ""strong RPG element"". Mind you, if you like it this way it's perfect, and I personally don't mind it too much. But the lack of RPG components does stay in the list as a promised not fulfilled. And no, madqueen, having 7 different finales that you get to choose doesn't make a looter/shooter an RPG.

- NPC unique daily routine and AI (https://www.vg247.com/2020/06/08/cyberpunk-2077-npcs-1000-daily-routines/)

- Quest decisions will have relevance in the world (https://onlysp.escapistmagazine.com/cyberpunk-2077-changes/)

- (half kept) Meaningful day and night cycle (right now it's mainly cosmetic and doesn't impact the gameplay a lot, e.g.: you aren't more stealthy at night) as described in Exploring Cyberpunk's Night City with CD Projekt Red - Cyberpunk 2077 - Gamereactor but it does something, like opening and closing some venues and modifying some population density. I have not seen evidence of places being more dangerous at night. If you have please record a clip and send it over.

- Incredible character customization during creation / in-game (https://gamecrate.com/cyberpunk-2077-boxing-power-weapons-militech-spider-robot-and-more/23426 and https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/cyberpunk-2077-character-creation/)

- Use of drones for more than just some missions in the game (https://gamecrate.com/cyberpunk-2077-boxing-power-weapons-militech-spider-robot-and-more/23426)

- three different lifepaths and more that would actually have more impact than what we are getting now (Wall running and metro system are not the biggest thing to be cut out from the game. Its the plot : cyberpunkgame (reddit.com)) for a better description on why lifepaths are poorly implemented. this post (https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kdmrju/the_corpo_life_path_makes_no_sense/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) is a good example.

- to add on the previous point, lifepaths leading to non-linear quest design. (https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2019/09/12/cyberpunk-2077-lifepath-system/)

- Nanowire and gorilla arms have a lot of different uses that are still in the description of the item (https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1153684171606450178?s=09).

- Runs very well on last gen consoles (source NOT needed)

- The game will launch when it's ready (source NOT needed)

- Variety of braindances instead of it being just few cutscenes (can't find reference, please link)(so far videos like this https://youtu.be/ToWfeUEAeeQ?t=1167 point that braindance is a cool mechanic but they never said we'd be able to purchase and use the braindances on our devices and all. I don't feel this is a broken promise, rather an aspect of the game that we would love to have had implemented).

- Challenging weather system that would pose a threat to your survival (https://www.windowscentral.com/cyberpunk-2077-features-acid-rain-and-other-deadly-environmental-challenges)

- At time of writing I haven't finished the game. However sources say there are very very few options for ONS and/or deep romances (this article summarizes what was expected https://www.ginx.tv/en/cyberpunk-2077/cyberpunk-2077-everything-about-relationships-romance-and-sex)

- Finishing the game without finishing the main quest ( https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thegamer.com/cyberpunk-side-quests-so-in-depth-finish-game-without-main-quest/amp/) At time of writing I haven't seen any progression just following the subplot and it looks like the main story is the quest to follow if I want to see an epilogue. This appears to be an error in translation during the interview.

- The game will let you select your body type and your gender freely, allowing you to obtain whatever combination of voice/gender/genitalia you want. Sex/Gender complete fluidity was something allowed in the cyberpunk tabletop games and very very relevant in the lore of the cyberpunk society (https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/culture/cyberpunk-2077-will-include-gender-free-character-creation-and-queer-relationships/amp/).

- A polished game and smooth experience (https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kd5qow/2018_interview_cyberpunk_2077_will_be_as_polished/)

- weapon customization (https://nightcitylife.de/index.php/features-artikel/341-xxl-preview-cyberpunk-2077-angespielt?start=5) although we got mods so this is half kept.

- 4 different styles, clearly highlighted, that you can adeere to and will make NPC react to it (https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=YlyDJVYqfpA). Please note that this was advertised as true 2 months before release.

"In 2020, what does it take to lose all the reputation and credibility that you’ve gained throughout the years? – [strike]getting caught[/strike] releasing a buggy mess of a game, that is barely a half of the game you promised…
Aaand getting caught with it.

[list]
[*]Overview
CP2077, in its current state at least, ends up as an RPG with a relatively huge and beautiful open world; with a ton of side content, but laughably short and linear main story. Gameplay-wise it reminds me of Fallout 4 or smth along these lines; a bit more fun and dynamic at times, but equally bugged and broken balance-wise. Actually, scratch that - it’s a mixture of Fallout 4 progression, combat and open world with dumb NPCs, Deus Ex stealth and Watch Dogs hacking mechanics.
And all of that multilayered cake is generously glazed with bugs, performance issues, and riddled with holes of cut content.
[*]Story
On one hand, the story and overall narration are phenomenal. Voice acting is top notch, cutscenes direction is great, and the mockup actors did a fantastic job. At times, I found myself so immersed that I even tried to simulate my character’s head movement via mouse. And sometimes I slowed down my pace, whether in car or on foot, just to enjoy the world’s atmosphere.
On the other hand - this is supposed to be an RPG, not a linear story. What was advertised was YOUR story, the story of YOUR character climbing the ranks in Night City, choosing who they wish to become as they progress. What we got, however, is a short story that constantly tries to rush you narratively, telling you that you’re constantly in a race against the clock (you aren’t). It also tries to make it a story about your relationship with one of the characters, but the issue is - despite seemingly numerous choices that supposedly affect said relationship, the only choices that actually matter are: 1) whether you complete this character’s questline and 2) what choices will you make during the final mission.
[*]Gameplay
Visually beautiful and detailed, multilevel city, filled to the brim with completely retarded NPCs. Seriously, if you ever thought that AI and traffic behavior in GTA or Watch Dogs were underwhelming, boy does this game have some news for you.
Overall, an okay-ish FPS with some neat tricks up its sleeve, but with a standard RPG leveling. Got into some area way too early? - Get ready to pump several tons of bullets into some elite enemy’s head. Want to make a full-melee build? - Go ahead, but what’s the point of melee combat in an FPS?
TES/Fallout inspired progression. In other words, you have to do/use particular stuff to level the corresponding skill tree. Some are simple and straightforward: use handguns to level up handgun handling/use rifles or SMGs to level up assault weapon tree. But some trees… Boy… Want to level up engineering? - Don’t just use Tech weapons - only kill enemies behind cover with charged shots. Wish to level up crafting? - Well, recall your days of blacksmithing 100500+ daggers in Skyrim and start crafting Epic rarity med kits… Only to learn that, apparently, nobody tested the crafting system and you can literally break the game’s economy via crafting, since you can get limitless resources (and, by extension - money) by dismantling certain items that you just crafted. The most annoying part is that there’s close to no point in upgrading items, since recrafting them is far more beneficial. Which, sadly, makes the Iconic items more of a nuisance, since most of them can’t be crafted more than once.,
Hacking and stealth - imagine a Deus Ex and Watch Dogs hybrid. Nuff said. Luckily, you’re almost never forced to go for a stealth approach, so you can just say discard your hacking capabilities and get yourself some other powerful combat implant, instead. Be advised, though - there will be some mission that you physically CANNOT COMPLETE without hacking, regardless of your skill., so you’ll have to visit Ripperdocs and change your implants from time to time.
Finally, cars. No customization; neither visual nor performance. Driving is… horrible, plain and simple. Calling up your vehicle has a 50/50% chance of it reaching you half-broken, due to dumb spawns.
 [*]Graphics
The visuals are… Umm… I don’t know - at certain points, they are amazing. The level design is, again, phenomenal most of the time. The game shows that a buttload of time and effort were put into it. But given the current state of CP2077 from the technical perspective… this picture gets occasionally ruined by some stupid bug way too often. Entire fields of garbage, flowing in mid-air; cars spawning half-broken, flying full speed into space; numerous issues with NPCs, both visual and collisions-related… It’s just hard to give any definitive verdicts.
[*]Sound
Luckily, some minor audio issues aside, everything is nearly perfect when it comes to sound in CP2077. Soundtrack is incredible; voice acting is, like mentioned before, top-notch, and the SFX quality is fairly decent, as well. My only complaint is that there are only two combat tracks that you get to hear in unscripted fights.
[/list]

[h1] Conclusion[/h1]
9/10 potential, but 6/10 in its current state:
-1 for false advertising and rushing the game when it clearly wasn’t ready for release.
-1 for numerous technical issues.
-1 for a ton of cut content, surprisingly short main story, and very limited RPG potential.
-1 for certain ridiculous balancing issues with economy, combat and progression.

With that in mind, I’m putting this game to rest until it’s finally updated to the state that is at least somewhat close to what has been promised to us during all these years.

Cyberpunk 2077 is much closer to a 'Rockstar' game, like Red Dead or the GTA series with a few hints of 'Destiny 1/2'.

It is a story-driven sandbox style game with very minor RPG elements.

The main story is about 20 hours worth of gameplay which feels less like a main quest and more like a side quest in terms of the small amount of content.

"[b] 8 YEARS [/b] in development and came out ridden with bugs, performance issues and cut content/missing features ? How ?! It feels as if it was made in the last 2-3 years and yet, even that amount of time seems long enough for most games to be developed properly without certain systems being broken upon release. 

Now, if you want to look it up, CDPR is not as big as... Ubisoft, for example, nor does it have the same amount of employees nor studios across the globe. I know it's a dumb comparison, but the point I'm trying to make is that CDPR has three studios at the moment, THE WROCŁAW STUDIO joining in 2018, as their third branch. Therefore, those 8 years of development, can be easily cut to about 4, maybe 5. More exactly since 2016, after CDPR released The Witcher's last expansion Blood and Wine, on the 31st of May. And so, I doubt that they could've made much while The Witcher 3 was developed (2012-2016), besides the story and an early build. Thus, the summer of 2016 could be when CDPR started to fully commit all their attention towards Cyberpunk 2077.

Rockstar, during their 8 years developing Red Dead Redemption 2, is the most accurate example with which one could compare CDPR's Cyberpunk 2077 developing team. Yet, the former managed to release a game that to this day, I consider to be one of the best looking games I've ever played on a console.   

If this would be compared with any other game, that released in the last 2 years, it would come out as second best, in most departments. I've seen better looking games, with more vibrant and detailed open-worlds perform way better on both consoles and Lower-End PC's than this game does. 

Thus far it seems, CDPR bit more then they could chew. And above all, they made the mistake to announce a release date, while unsure of the game's state. They should've kept to their word, '>COMING: WHEN IT'S READY'. And do something similar to what Bethesda has done in the past. And just pop in to say: 'Hey ! Guess what ? IT'S READY !'. Then release the game two months later. 

Unfortunately, that didn't happened...

[h1] Performance: [/h1] 

I didn't expect the game to run on 60 FPS, because of my CPU, which is an FX-8350. Yeah. However I did expect or rather hoped, for a stable experience, around 40-50 FPS on Medium-High. The trick is, I was partly right. It does run, on High even (obviously, with Cascaded Shadows Range & Cascaded Shadows Resolution on Low), however the occasional FPS drops, range from 20-30, dropping the overall FPS sometimes into the mid 20s, and that, I did not expect.  Yet, after some tinkering within NVIDIA Control Panel, I managed to solve the issue, and reduced the drops from 50 to 30 by about 10-15, whilst still keeping the game on High. Then, updated my graphics card driver (GTX 1070) to 460.89 (released on 15/12/2020), which surprisingly further reduced the drops in certain areas. So by now I manage around 32-35 FPS in the middle of the city, and around 40-50 FPS on the outskirts, and  55+ outside of Night City. Which is very good for an outdated system alike mine.

Also, I played my first 20 hours on Ultra, and the only downside of that was about 7 FPS, while the drops without NVIDIA Control Panel remained the same, so 20-30. Haven't tried to see how the game performs with them though. And as for Lower Presets, not much improvement, actually the game runs smoother on High, because on the Low or Medium Presets I experienced stuttering.  

[h1]![/h1] After patch 1.05, the game works even better without the NVIDIA Control Panel settings, and as far as I've noticed, it never drops below 30 FPS.

P.S : It makes no damn difference whatsoever, if you install the game on an SSD or an HDD. I for one haven't seen any improvement. The load times are the same in both cases.

[h1] Gameplay: [/h1]

[b] The stealth: [/b] It's decent, can be done with ease, and if one's creative enough it can be quite fun. When bug free...

'Cause, through my 100 hours of playtime, I've experienced NPC's that see you sometimes through walls. Detect bodies when they clearly detected squat, because I hid them all in containers (Hitman style), and at times were alerted by the wind, while I wasn't in their line of sight, nor was I detected by cameras. 

[b] The hacking: [/b] useful when attempting to be stealthy, and effective in combat. Blind one enemy, by rebooting optics, then chuck a grenade at his feet. There are plenty of ways to help yourself gain the upper hand during any kind of encounter.

[b] The Weapons/Guns, or none at all, but your bare fists (perhaps, cybernetically enhanced): [/b] 

There are many weapons, from Knives, Machete, Khukuri, Katanas to Pistols, Revolvers, Rifles, Shotguns and Sniper Rifles. And you're going to go through them much alike a tornado through a town. You're going to pick 'em up, so you can throw 'em out later. Because Crafting or Upgrading your stuff, is either expensive or just useless, at least early in the game. 

[b] Driving: [/b] It's decent. Some cars feel heavy, others light and nimble. I don't know what people complain about. A piece of advice, even if it's the distant future, try using the break before turning... 

[h1] Open-World & RPG: [/h1]

It is as if, CDPR, wanted to cram everything under the sun in their new game.  Which I welcome every developer out there to try, the more complex and dynamic your game the more it adds to it's value, I think. BUT, if you fail to implement those systems well enough, and  somehow don't manage to smooth out the rough edges, so that they pull on the player's attention, then that is not good. 

They tried to blend a Deus Ex game, with a GTA world, The Witcher 3's RPG mechanics, and Destiny's loot. Does it work ? Yes it does. Really ? No...

But, the world ? Oh, man. The world, the iconic, dystopian, neon light drenched, Night City, is just amazing. There are few settings in gaming that look as good as Night City does. With tall skyscrapers, dark back alleys illuminated by neon lights and a buzzing flickering lamppost. Steam emerging out a gutter, trash bins to one side, next to a pile of empty, broken bottles scattered around. As further down that same alley, amidst the hustle and bustle of the city,  
laughter and chatter become clearer. About six neighborhood kids, gangster wanna be, two breaking bottles, as the rest break the skull of some corpo. 

Just alike The Witcher, CDPR crafted a very well designed, atmospheric world. That often reminds me, aesthetically, of Neo Tokyo from Akira and Los Angeles from Blade Runner. And all of the above, along with the masterfully crafted soundtrack, offer a great escape into the dark future. 

At times...

'Cause the NPC/AI are buggy and poorly done. A huge step down from what we've seen in The Witcher, for example. While their wanted system and the cops, are among the worst I've ever seen... 

[h1]Story:[/h1]

Sadly, it's nowhere near as intricate as CDPR let it out to be, nor the masterpiece most praise it to be. Yet, it can be really good, and other times it's noticeable how it was cut then put back together in haste to make out something coherent, which leaves no lasting impression, nor does it have many memorable moments. As it's two acts, of almost 20+ hours, are the consequence of major content cuts, in order to squeeze the game into a wanted release timetable.  

For example, if the intro alone would've been about 5-10 hours long, instead of a mere hour. The player could've been properly introduced to Jackie, and other characters within Night City. But no, instead, we get a cheap montage. After which, no matter what Life Path you choose, the story plays out pretty much the same way.

Just look up the cut content, because CDPR, butchered this game prior to release...

I hope they add the missing features/content in future patches, because the whole game would really benefit from it, not just the story. If they don't, well it's pretty clear why, since the Multiplayer is coming in 2022...",True
If Fushigi was a video game it would be Cyberpunk 2077. It’s fun for a while but you realize it’s not at all what it was hyped up to be. CDPR dun goofed.,False
"Albeit I've sunk an enormous amount of time into the game and have really enjoyed it for what it is, which is more Open World Deus Ex: Human Revolution than a strict RPG I would honestly suggest people give it a couple of months (say end of Feb 2021) for the developers to patch out the bugs that currently plague the game.  I haven't encountered much that I would class as 'game breaking', but there are definitely a few wrinkles that CDP need to iron out yet. With that said, I'm not going to suggest 'wait for a sale' as the game is worth the asking price in terms of content, scope and ambition, it's just a little under-cooked in its present state is all.",True
"This is currently the best example as to why game companies should never let a game get too much hype. While CDPR did not push any envelopes with this release. Game play is honestly nothing new, the game setting is a welcome change in the modern day landscape and so far the story is quite good.

I honestly think that due to the amount of hype and CDPR lack of readiness for this release. Is the main reason why the game is sitting at the rating it has. I strongly suggest waiting until there is a sale or if CDPR decides to flesh out the game play a bit more.

Only buy this game if you are going in it blind and not expecting much like I did.",True
"I recommend Cyberpunk 2077. Although there is a lot of controversy revolving around this game at the moment, it doesn't necessarily make it a bad game. I am a strong believer of the ""hype kills games"" statement, for the reason that nothing in life will ever live up to the hype/ expectations of consumers if blown up enough. This is the case for Cyberpunk. I went into this game practically blind. I saw a couple trailers a month before it came out and never got caught up in the hype. And I think this is part of the reason I love this game so much. Sure the game is unpolished, I think we all can agree on that. But that aside, this game is great. Now with almost all of the game breaking bugs fixed, the game is in a good enough state to be only played on PC or next gen hardware. 

Playing through, I genuinely felt that my decisions and actions mattered, making me feel immersed in the experience. I thought how in depth and believable the world and characters CDPR made in this game were very believable. I found myself coming to really like some of the characters and I was glad that they had so much personality. As far as gameplay goes, this game is nothing special. it didn't feel unique to me in any way. But may I remind you, this doesn't make it a bad game. Very few triple A games now, like Control, are able to achieve unique gameplay anyway. It would have been nice to see that in this game. As far as narrative, story, atmosphere, choice, and characters, Cyberpunk 2077 blows it out of the park. In my opinion small things like physics not being as good as GTA V, civilian/driving AI being simple, etc, are yes valid complaints, but are poor reasons to hate and dub a game ""bad"" or ""a joke"".

In summation, if you are into a good story, characters, and atmosphere, I recommend giving Cyberpunk 2077 a try. But with this, keep in mind this game isn't perfect and has its issues much like any other game glitches aside. With this game's vast Night City, in-depth side missions and story, it's safe to say that this game isn't as bad as some consumers are making it out to be. And for what it has to offer it's definitely worth 60 big ones.

"[h1]FROM SWORDS AND MAGIC TO GUNS AND CYBERWARE[/h1]
Cyberpunk 2077 is the first new IP by CDPR, it was originally a tabletop RPG callled Cyberpunk 2020 created by Mike Pondsmith since the 1980s, this game is a open world action RPG which is set in the near future where body augmentations are the norm. It's pretty similar with Fallout and Deus Ex with sprinkles of Blade Runner, AKIRA, Ghost In The Shell, Dredd and bunch of other similar Cyberpunk movies.

This is the first ever game by CDPR since the Witcher series which they had never made before but oh boy they actually did an amazing job with the game. This game is more like Witcher but with guns but not like GTA, so if you coming here expecting GTA welp go ask Rockstar for GTA 6 cause you will be disappointed :P
Of course, the game is actually good so i didn't really care about the weird negativity about it
Don't buy this game if you want lots of open world activities, Cyberpunk 2077 focuses more on quests and side quests which allows players to approach levels with whatever way possible like the Deus Ex games, you want to go guns blazing or stealth with hacking or non lethal without touching anyone, all playstyles are viable.

[h1]PROS[/h1]
+Story writing and characters are fantastic: It's no secret that CDPR can create amazing stories with well-written characters especially since Witcher, all of the characters here are unique and all have their motives and personalities
+Gameplay/Combat: With the right skills and gear, the combat in this game is so freaking good like seriously it's also super flexible if you want to run guns with hack or hack n slash or stealth n shotguns all of it are viable, hacking builds are super OP, if you spec well you can literally one shot enemies. There are already plenty of videos around showing how much potential the combat has you can even BUNNYHOP in this game(Don't patch pls CDPR). Here is example of some BADASS gameplay with good gear and skills both [url=https://youtu.be/JyhXJgVFoLU]loud[/url] and [url=https://youtu.be/QYI0TF3CDA8]stealth[/url]. 
+Gunplay: My god, i didn't expect this game to have great gunplay but here we are i personally LOVE the guns in this game, the sounds, the impact of the weapons feel punchy, ther recoil feels fun to control, the reload animations are also fantastic look at Johnny's pistol so SEXY [url=https://youtu.be/2S4xUQyjhgc]video here.[/url]
+Graphics: This game is by far the best looking game ever made, especially if you have RTX card in your PC it will melt your PC but even on low settings which is my system (I5-7300 HQ, GTX1050ti, 16GBRAM, SSD) the game looks absolutely fantastic. Goddamn its so beautiful
+Animations: I dunno why not many reviews pointed this out but the animations in this game are amazing, stare at a character and look at their body language and lip sync they are so detailed and realistic. The lip sync technology JALI is pretty great tech too that should be used in other games.
+Art direction and City Design: Mother of god, everything about this game's city architecture, neon lights, ads, the way the city is layout is so damn perfect and should be commended. This is the only game i know that lets you go UP (rooftops etc) and DOWN(basements, freeways, road system) without loading screens. The fact that some places has freeways or restaurants or anything below or above you are so goddamn eye dropping. Verticality is epic in this game.  The vehicles also look great
+Level Design: The game allows you to either stealth or go loud, both are viable due to the level design. You can go up to weird places such as windows, roofs and etc to inflitrate a building. Not all playstyles are viable for all locations, it make sense because some places either closed or open you have to be smart and take advantage of the environment (Deus Ex gang).
+Music: My god, the music in this game is fantastic literally all of it are good and during tense moments it is used very well it's perfect i have no rights to complaint about it.
+Sound design: Just superb, it makes me feel like i'm in an actual city 
+Side quests and ""Gigs"" are fantastic: Like Witcher 3, the sidequests are really freaking good and your choices will decide the outcome of some characters. Some are REALLY FUNNY while some are super f**k up, a lot of variety here. The gigs are different they're like fetch quests EXCEPT check the laptops + shards even in the side gigs. A lot more dialogues options and outcomes will open up. If a job feels like a regular fetch quest, you are missing out. I feel bad when people say the gigs are bad even though it literally has good lore.
+Lore: If you watch lore videos like Madqueen Show or Neon Arcade that it based on the original tabletop game, the game feels more epic and some of the moments that are told in text are present a lot in this game :) (Mike Pondsmith is a genius) 

Well, so far the game as it stands it's passed as a good game now let's talk about Neutral and Cons

[h1]NEUTRAL[/h1]
+/-Driving is good: It can be good or bad depending on the player, personally i think the cars and motorcycles are alright. Some handles better than another though, i personally like the driving it has weight in it so you cannot expect to throttle and instantly go around the corner, break and handbrake around corners so you can safely turn
+/-Some decisions doesn't matter? I dunno man, i asked some of my friends me and my friend had very different things that happened, e.g without spoiling i didn't get to go to this location or save someone while my friend is complete opposite. Sometimes, dialogue options only appear when you go read the computers or shards so.... please explore more cause it actually does change outcomes if you pay attention closely
+/-Missing features???: Like trains and something, but honestly game development changes a lot and honestly hearing some of the supposedly ""cut"" features doesn't really bother me much cause if they add it does really add much to the game when the main meat here is the story?
+/-NPCs can be good or just boring but honestly it doesn't affect because to me they're just there to be there, its not like they will help me in quests or anything and most of the time i dont bother looking at them cause you know they're NPCs i dunno why people are obssesed with them of course it can be better but hoenstly quests should be the focus not NPCs
+/-AI: When they work, they hit like a truck when they dont haha tech sniper go BRRR into the cover.
+/-Menu UI can be better: When they sold cars to you, i dont see any images of the vehicle in the quest log which is kinda hard to know what vehicle you want to buy based on the looks . 

[h1]CONS[/h1]
-Bugs: Personally i didn't ran into bugs that made the game unplayable most of it are funny bugs or i can just reload my saves and it will work. There are some UI bugs from time to time but reload save and it will work. I dunno why people were so unlucky with their game. Hopefully CDPR can address this 
-Police A.I: I think it's bugged, there is no reason for them to spawn behind me it is so immersion breaking and annoying when this happens, i think there are videos showing the police AI are in the files it's just bugged currently.
-Optimization: My PC isn't the best but during day 1 the game perform poorly at 30 fps at low settings but after patches and some tweaks in ran smoothly at 40-50fps with dips here and there. Honestly, it's playable the more i play it the better the game performs lol. 
-Barber shop or body shop: In a world where you can literally change your body why can't we change our hairstyle at the very least :( 


I personally give this game 9/10 and i would personally rate as my GAME OF THE YEAR because it has surpassed all my expectations, of course it can better with updates and DLCs. Overall, i'm very satisfied with this game and cannot wait to do more playthroughs. Don't come here expecting GTA, expect Witcher and Deus Ex but with guns and cyberware :)",True
"""Yes it looks amazing, but everything else is lacking.""

""They poured all the budget into graphics, lens flare, and Keanu Reeve's paycheck and forgot they were making a game.""


This game doesn't do anything well and I feel like it's getting a free pass just because of how good looking it is and the fact that it's ""temporarily"" pested by bugs. People are acting as if when the bugs are ironed out it will be the game of the decade or something, no.. not by a long shot. I predict it will be mostly forgotten in a year and will only be remembered by the amount of hype it amassed. 

It's shocking how the AI and open world of GTA IV (2008) was light-years ahead than what we're getting on the most anticipated game of 2020.

Decision-based story telling was done better by Bioware 10 years ago. Breathing open worlds were done better by Rockstar 7 years ago. RPG mechanics were done better by Bethesda 10 years ago. Aside from graphics there's not a single aspect of this game that goes above and beyond what you'd expect from any AAA game 5 years ago. 

A lot of people are saying it's GREAT just because of how popular it is right now, the game created a massive critical mass of fanboys before it even launched.. those people WANT the game to be great and convince themselves it's everything they were expecting solely because they've been waiting for so long but truly, in a vacuum this is a good game at best. 

There's nothing new or interesting to see here. I expected a lot more from a studio with CDPR's streetcred. Witcher 3 is better than this in almost every aspect. They built a really pretty open world but forgot to make a engaging game ontop of it.",False
"Ever get wanted in Cyberpunk? How'd you like the auto pop-in Police and being able to drive away from them in seconds? Or the promised romance options which amounted to 4? only 1 for each, gay male, gay female, straight man and straight woman.
4 mini-games that don't even scratch the surface of what gwent was, not that it has to, but kinda disappointing.
Backgrounds mean very little, fashion style you pick doesn't matter
Otherwise I really enjoy the game (Excluded the bugs ofc)

Unoptimized, janky and bugs bugs bugs. I'll change my revew to a positive one as soon as bugs and optimization is done",False
"This game has one of the most engaging open world system in terms of replay-ability, loot, map and level design, activities and progression. I find myself spending a lot of time running around shooting at thugs and criminals than actually progressing the game because it is fun. As someone who don't usually have time to invest in story-related missions and quests, this game has consistently delivered good story telling aspects in terms of dialogue, visuals, mechanics and cinematography to keep its audience engaged and compelled. There are further improvements that CDPR can implement like the various customization options in open world games and improve certain QOL features that would help enhance the overall gameplay experience. It would also be an improvement to make more settings accessible that one would only be able to change in the config files. 

It is especially sad to see how many people out there bashing this game and their reasoning on how ""shitty"" this game is, when it is mostly projection of their overly exaggerated expectation of their perfect game. Yes, it took 8 years to develop this game but why do these people with their inflated ego and privilege think that justifies anything about the current state of the game? Sure it has massive amounts of visual glitches and even game-breaking bugs, but instead of having proper discussions and constructive criticism towards positive feedback on future patches and bug fixes, these individuals are so invested on the cancel culture bandwagon going on right now. It's so disappointing how toxic gamer culture in times like these can be so damaging, and the arrogance is incredibly apparent that these individuals think CDPR actually owes them something. 

The majority of the public hating on this game have too high of an expectation in a video game. Comparing them with GTAV, Red Dead Redemption 2, or any other games would obviously highlight the contrast in comparison to CP2077, but that in no way compromises the quality of Cyberpunk2077 as all these games share their own unique aspects as well as imperfections. Cyberpunk 2077 might not be at it's optimal state at this point, but they have established very good foundations that can potentially make this a masterpiece. 

10/10
 
",True
"Sure it's buggy as hell and probably unfinished, but it's also beautiful and immersive and has moments of pure greatness. At the end of every play session it makes me want to come back to it the next day and play some more, and isn't that the most important thing about a videogame?",True
"These are my first impressions after about 3 hours of playing so far. Did the first couple missions or so. Walked around and got overwhelmed with the seemingly massive size of Night City.

So graphics up first, the game looks stellar. Nice textures, lighting, character faces and animations, etc. It all looks very very nice. Performance on a  10700K + RTX 3080 easily runs 4K with Ray Tracing disabled, 80-100fps depending on the scene/area. Ray Tracing enabled I'm seeing low 50fps and can maintain right at 60-65fps (RT on Medium, graphics all on high/ultra). DLSS is a must with RT and needs to be on performance mode. I set DLSS to quality mode when I turned RT off. Anyone with lower end hardware will have a crappy experience if they're going right in cranking all the settings to ultra.

Combat has been spotty so far. A couple strange animations here and there and kind of stiff movement depending on the action. But overall, not bad imo. They did a good job on the gun animations and reloads. Gun tones/sounds could use a little more ""punch"" when being fired though.

The bad: Audio. It is so unbalanced it's not even funny. It's actually terrible. NPC voices are laughably loud, like to the point I don't even want to talk to them. And then ambient noises in the distance that should be very quiet and in the background  sound like they are right next to me and drowning out any main quest dialog. CDPR needs to patch the audio asap. It's bad. I cannot believe they f**ked this up. I tried all the audio settings too. Unfortunately they do not affect NPC dialog. The main mission with Jackie when you enter into Night City for the 1st time, I literally could not hear what the hell he was saying because the ambient sounds completely over powered him. Luckily, subtitles were on.

Character creation is awesome. Probably the best I've seen in a video game ever. You could literally spend an hour alone making a single character.

Character development like skills, traits, mods, etc. is overwhelming. I need to read through everything at some point to get a grasp of all the skills and stuff. It's almost endless it seems.

Most of the cut scene animations are amazing with the attention to detail. I'm so glad CDPR made it to where you can actually see your legs and feet. I cannot stand first person games when you're basically floating around with no legs. There is a lot of stuff to take in with this game. A lot of little hidden nuances and things everywhere you'll miss if you're not paying attention. A couple small patches from CDPR and this will easily be a 10/10 for me.",True
"This game does seem a bit rushed in some areas, but I have no doubt CDPR will fix those issues and then some, just like they did with Witcher 3. Where they should focus their attention is making the city feel more alive. NPC AI needs lots of improvements, just check out NPC behavior in Watch Dogs for example. Also needs more side activities like in GTA V.",True
"[h1]Hopes were heightened leading up to the game[/h1]


Cyberpunk 2077 is far and wide one of the longest awaited games of my life. I still remember sitting in my college dorm seeing the trailer play out on my roomate's laptop in 2012. I kept a keen eye on the game, watching it conceptually build and grow over the course of about 9 years. My thoughts of the story wandered from the first trailer; ""will we be playing as members of the psycho squad? Making moral decisions on being a dirty or clean cop?"", evolved in the second trailer; ""So we have multiple avenues, we are either from the gritty streets, or glossy highrises"", and finally burst with the final trailer; ""HOLY SHIT ITS KEANU REEVES"". 

On December 9th, all of that build up; all of that hope in a company I could swear fealty to was completely misplaced. 

While there are some cool moments in this game that kept the light from dying immediately, I can not in [u]good faith[/u] suggest to anyone that they buy this game. 


[h1]What feels wrong about the game; The reasons you just shouldn't touch it.[/h1]



-[b]Reason 1: Core Development Issues[/b]

 The game as it stands is messed up on a development level that feels like it may never quite recover from. Patch 1.1 has clearly shown that fixing one problem is only going to bring up a slew of more problems, two examples being the Takemura phone call bricking the entire save, and npc ai suddenly developing a new claptrap personality with an aversion to stairs. 



-[b]Reason 2: Combat/Gameplay[/b]

As far as gameplay/combat goes, everything feels bland after a short while. In the gameplay preview, V is gliding with both horizontal and vertical mobility, hacking into a network of people, using cool and seemingly unique abilities that were going to be based on each play through to achieve their ends. The final product feels akin to ""Big brain slow play path"", utilizing hacking and waiting for cooldowns against very predictable and honestly un-engaging AI to pop them, or ""fast fast shooty way"" which is just running at and emptying ammo into bullet sponges until you get paid. 



-[b]Reason 3: Story[/b]

The storyline and quest layout feels like nothing that was promised. In the same vein that combat feels bland, the storyline also follows up with an inability to deliver on ""Impactful"" decision-making. In the Witcher 3, a game with almost a completely set storyline, players were still given agency about how they ventured forth in the world through the eyes of Geralt of Rivia. Cyberpunk had the express opportunity to deliver on a completely open experience, a city-wide palette that could be lovingly painted with each player decision. This game is strewn with a bunch of same-y quests, all aligned with the objective of ""go to X and shoot Y person"", with the only caveat of being ""shoot them quietly"" to get paid extra. The main story, while showing sparks of hope with great voice actors and characters like Jackie, Johnny, and Takemura,  completely fell on it's face to the point that I relegated myself to just doing the same-y sidequests until I quit out of boredom. Knowing that the choices aren't actively giving multiple avenues of story (for example, nearly every scene with a timed response was replayed, the timed responses have almost 0 impact) is an unnecessary fat that either needs to be built upon, or cut from the game, because it provides complete and utter frustration. The life paths also have no impact, once again taking agency away from the player, asking for their own story, but not giving them a page to write on.



[h1] Closing thoughts [/h1]


To re-iterate, Cyberpunk is by far the biggest disappointment to be felt in video game. [i]Ever[/i]. This disappointment is amplified because it comes from a company that many, like myself, truly rest all faith upon. Even after delays, many were still in CDPR's corner, patiently waiting for the game to blow everyone's expectations out of the water, eagerly awaiting that moment they could say ""I told you so"" to all the people questioning the hype and faith. Some, maybe even myself, still are. Reality is slowly closing the door and crushing hope, so until this review changes, Samurai, we have other games to burn.",False
"I have chosen HARD difficulty, but the battles are very far from hard. The AI are just hiding in their spots, not engaging in a way they should. f.e. A huge assault robot is just standing and shooting instead of moving towards my position while I am hiding, crouching. That's very sad...

The companion Jack is just hitting ant shooting an unconscious enemy while there are other enemies that are shooting him. And the way that the companion moves is a bit unnatural sometimes.

I also noticed some strange sound issues, f.e. u can hear conversations of people while you are moving in a car during conversation with an NPC.

The game is a bit buggy and sometimes feels unfinished or a bit old. But the idea and the immersion due to first person camera is fantastic. The story is superb, the controls are nice.

The game needs updates and fixes.",True
"[b]This is how I Feel:[/b]

CD Project RED made The Witcher 3, and that game blew minds 5 years ago. It still blows minds today and hasn't aged one bit. Going into Cyberpunk 2077 I expected the same level of detail, and most of all [i]innovation.[/i]

Anddd it's there. In a way.


[b]Missions[/b]

Side Missions:
The detail put into side quests is absolutely the same quality of the main missions. The typical Open-World ""Fetch this then I'll help you"" they somehow avoided, and instead they promote showing you to unique characters within the world of Cyberpunk, with some VERY creative and never-thought-of before stories that they are experiencing. [spoiler]The Political Sidequests & the Man who wanted to Record his Death come to mind[/spoiler]

Main Missions:
In the Witcher 3, (They made TW3 so I feel using it as a benchmark is necessary,) The main Storyline was so Massive you could count each section of the story it's own (massive) mini-story that helped reveal the overall plot. Most notably the Bloody Baron quests.

Going into Cyberpunk I expected this, but shorter as they told us it would be. But it is [u]shockingly[/u] shorter. Just when I figured I would be finishing the first major ""mini-story"" within the main story, I was informed that I was at the last mission. The last mission! Yet I had at least 30 side quests in my missions tab, not counting the dozens more littered all over my map that I hadn't gotten to yet. And I'd done maybe 2 side quests for every main mission!


[b]The World[/b]

It's Pretty. Very Pretty. However it's ONLY Pretty.

I recently played some GTA V after Cyberpunk and for the first time saw how outdated the graphics were. Cyberpunk has the richest of the rich, and the poorest of the poor, and the piles of trash, neon signs, road textures, verticality and lighting show that detail everywhere. it. is. [i]Gorgeous.[/i] Cyberpunk is the new level of detail benchmark in cities, at least in my book.

However, while Cyberpunk compared to TW3 doesn't have any [i]less[/i] ways of interacting with the environment, it feels to me that it certainly doesn't seem to have [i]more.[/i] Food vendors are just NPC's with interactable inventories, and they hardly even change if you're at a sushi stand or a random street vendor. You can side with some gangs and make other's mad, but after awhile all of them kind of feel the same, and I found myself avoiding them most of the time unless I had a new gun to test out.

Verticality isn't Much.
Yes, there is more verticality here than in any game I've ever played in this format. But the [b]mass majority[/b] of buildings in Cyberpunk you cannot enter, and even if you can there is one or maybe 2 floors you can visit.

On top of all that, I was generally disappointed with the lack of innovation.
Granted, there were no promises here, but imagine a world of Cyberpunk where you could topple skyscrapers! Or blow holes in walls then enter and wipe out a gang! Or massive gang wars in the streets that your actions in a political quest could change! But sadly that is not here. The detail placed on missions never carries over into the world in any meaningful game-changing ways imo.


[b]How does it [i]feel?[/i][/b]

Cars are fine, you get used to it. They are best when drifting.
Bikes are great, they are worst when drifting.
But the way all vehicles interact with surfaces is like an Ubisoft game, where it feels clunky as if the vehicles don't quite belong. This is no stunt-begging orgasmic driving simulator/arcade like in GTA V, this is a way to get from point A to B.

(And Lord have mercy on your little cyberpunked soul if you try to go offroading. The game does not want you there for some reason.)

Guns feel good, some are better than others, but there are a noticeable lack of attachments. The distinctive different classes of guns makes up for that though.

The biggest crime here is the gameplay outside of missions and just walking around sucks. No holding up stores, no player-created heists, and ""cop chases"" consist of cops spawning behind you and drones shooting homing missiles. Shooting random gang spawns is the only freeroam gunplay that isn't completely unfair and void of enjoyment.


[b]In Closing[/b]

This is getting a bit long so I'll wrap things up.
I believe we (myself included) are used to open-world games set in city environments, so when CD Project RED tries it we are comparing them to the finest in the industry. (Rightfully so, there is nothing wrong with that.) Let us also remember that this is their [i]second[/i] AAA title [i]ever.[/i] First in this setting which is remarkable considering how different the Witcher 3 is.

Cyberpunk 2077 is not perfect. But it is still a very fun game, even if it often reminds you of what could have been.",True
"There are still some minor bugs but they are easy to ignore and not game-breaking. I hope CDPR will solve the problems along the way. If you like RPGs, the game is for you. Not for you if you do not like dialogues,",True
"This game is not good because it is not finished. Good graphics do not maketh game. This is hot garbage, through and through. It's ok to enjoy to it, but not for $60. This is a $20 game at best.

Everything required to become immersed in a video game's world is done poorly here. The NPCs are zombies and identical in every single way. The world is large, bright, and shiny but boring as hell with invisible walls all over the place. The driving is so piss poor, that you'll fast travel everywhere because of the inconvenience.

The combat is acceptable at it's best. Melee combat is so, so bad though and isn't excusable when one of the main perks in the game is getting swords in your arms, or gorilla strength to pummel people. The shooting is ok. There are a few different weapon variants, but they all feel the same after a couple hours. Find whatever does the most damage and go with it.

The side quests are the exact same, over and over and over and over again. Go here, kill these people, find a yellow box, leave. Go there, kill these people, walk this person to a car, leave. Go there again, help the police kill people, get fired on by police, escape, police magically teleport behind you, you die. With the exception of a couple side quests, these arent worth the time unless you're obsessed with making icons go off your map.

The main story is the only part of the game that had thought and effort put into it, and it's amazing that it comes off as bad as it does. It just happens. There's not really any character development leaving you to give a shit about anyone. Keanu Reeves just kind of shows up and your character is like, ok this is a thing now, and the relationship is normalized in a span of two minutes. Which is crazy because of all the bullshit leading up to that moment.

The driving is PS2 era quality, and that's being generous. Somehow tire quality or road construction became so bad that every vehicle feels like it's driving on ice. Physics cease to exist whether you're in or on a vehicle. Want to spin 360 degrees on a motorcycle bouncing off cars and street lights while taking no damage or falling off? Fuck yeah welcome to the future baby! The driving sucks. I fast traveled everywhere to avoid it, which means I missed out on seeing a lot of that big, boring, bland world. Grand Theft Auto V is almost 8 years old and set a precedent for vehicular travel in video games. This state of the art game doesn't come close, it's not even in the shadows of GTAV.

Crafting was supposed to be some big deal in this game. What it really is: collecting items legitimately called ""crafting components"" that are several different colors in order of rarity. Want to make a new gun? Have 30 green components, 20 blue components, and 10 orange components and you're good! How boring. There's no joy or anything in crafting. No missions to find a rare part to complete a special build, no haggling with a hidden merchant to purchase parts or schematics, no bosses to take down that have a locked chest containing parts. You can buy components, dismantle items, or find components in chest. Just components.

The inventory / journal screens are confusing. They look like shit. There's no clear way how to navigate the options and menus within them. Want to access your journal page from the inventory page? Do you have 30 grenades you want to sell? Too bad, theres no sell all option so you have to manually choose how many you want to sell every goddamn time. So many clicks to get rid of pointless shit. Thank god they have a ""sell junk"" item that clears that inventory. Every time I hit ""sell junk"" I was hoping my game would disappear and my money would be back in my wallet.

The bugs? There are so, so, so many of them that have been shown everywhere. It's not worth explaining. I'm on PC and haven't encountered nearly the amount that console players have. But goddamn this game... this game is beyond Bethesda caliber of bugs.

This game fucking sucks in almost every single way. Those that are preaching it are either paid to praise or base their quality of a game on the graphics alone. Look through the reviews here. All the positive reviews say, ""GRAPHICS GOOD!"". This game is two years early, a hot plate of shit thrown onto the table of gamers everywhere, in an effort to cash in on covid and everyone being forced to do nothing but look at screens. If you're seriously promoting people to buy this game, you're a huge cause of the problem in the industry these days and you should be ashamed.

"Hello everyone ;
Certainly a lot of effort has been put into making and designing this game ;
Eight years !
With additional packages and free delay ;
Delays that enticed everyone, even myself, with the release of seductive videos ;
And finally we saw the release of the game ;
The game, whether we are a launcher or a console, surprised everyone with its beautiful and unbelievable bugs ;
The bugs and their number were formed as if they were intentional ;
I don't know, maybe it wasn't ;
Anyway, this game insulted all gamers and was disappointing ;
All those who have been waiting for it for years and enduring its delays ;

I hope this never happens again, although I know it will happen again ;
What Sony did was right, it makes us see games in the new generation that deserve the quality of this generation ;
Finally , I hope that if Cyberpunk 3077 is to be released in the future, it will be better and focus more on rich content than content ... ;
Better AI and fewer bugs and less latency ;

They said it needed much refine before shipping, we didn't care.
As the whole world didn't want to wait any longer, they shipped it. Now, we have a really good game with a lot of bugs, in the meanwhile CD Projekt RED is fixing it in the next patches.

But over all, the game looks great, the whole universe looks intersting and there's no doubt the game is really well done artisticly. The combat mechanics is a little weird but you can call it okay, yet, there's a lot of things to be done to make it what it really can be.

"Attention AMD Users: There is a AMD FIX TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE WITH THIS TITLE. JUST SEARCH UP CYBER PUNK AMD CPU FIX. IT INCREASED PERFORMANCE 10-15% OVERALL AND NOW MAKES IT A MORE ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE. I LOVE THE STORY IT IS LITERALLY THE BEST STORY FOR AN OPEN WORLD GAME LIKE THIS. EVEN BETTER THAN GTA V CAMPAIGN. THIS IS ALSO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GAME I EVER PLAYED I remember looking back and wishing to play an open world game this immersive and with so much to explore whether it be the cyberphysics, GIGs, and other side missions make this game enjoyable. Also, this version is definitely the best one as of yet and even on a ultrawide monitor at 2560x1080, 75hz, GTX 1080 HYBRID AND AMD R7 3800X @ 4.25GHz AND 32GB HYPER X RAM @3733MHz and it run at 50-75hz on high settings and vsync on to prevent screen tearing glitches. And while the game has noticable glitches that even I noticed and most of them are funny af.

Funny Glitch one: I was on 3 health and couldn't heal in time, a Police Officer shot at one of my tires and it launnch it up and crushed all three officers which allowed me to gain some street cred. and this glitch has helped me through the roughest times with this game.

THINGS TO NOTE: SOME CASUAL PLAYERS MIGHT NOT USE THE SAVE FEATURE SINCE THE GAME ONLY AUTOSAVES AT CHECKPOINTS. I FOUND THIS OUT AFTER THE GAME CRASHED AND HAD ME START THE MISSION BACK OVER SO MAKE SURE YOU REMEMBER TO SAVE WHENEVER YOU'RE BETWEEN MISSIONS OR EVEN DURING THE MISSIONS WHEN YOU'RE NOT IN COMBAT. That definitely helped.

Learning Curve: This game has a small learning curve as far as combat and especially hacking it took me four hours to get used to it but got used to it due to side missions. Also carefully leveling up you per points and attribute points will help you  hack through certain doors and elevators during missions. Doing the SP assignment wisely is critically to beat some hard AF missions and saving five to ten minutes depending on the mission.

Overall: The game does need a lot of polishing but the funny glitches definitely make me getting stoned a lot more comical. I'm 30 hours in and barely into the story since I'm enjoying Night City and the different interactions with the NPC and side characters. Also, Genital size is the type of thing us men need in a world of man shaming comics.

I tried my absolute best, but even after disabling motion blur, chromatic abberation and additive camera motions it's still messing with my vision and makes me feel awful. Adjusting the field of view didn't help much either. There are many other FPS games that feel a lot smoother and are still tolerable even for me. Honestly a very questionable decision on their part considering all the hype surrounding this title.",False

"[h1] 9 years of hype gone in 5 days. [/h1]

Followed the hype for 9 years, believed everything CD Projekt Red said, since The Witcher 3 was a masterpiece and one of my favorite games. We are now at the end of 2020 and oh boy, goodbye to the last company in this industry I had my hopes up for.

Let's start with the cons first:

[b] Story [/b]

As seen and read from all trailers and interviews, your choice of lifepath would have a huge impact on the story, like the 3 characters of GTAV have each their own story to follow. But instead, we got a 30 minute first impression of your lifepath, and from there all paths will collide into one railroad of linear storytelling. You sometimes get the option in dialogue to express your feelings as Nomad, Streetkid or Corpo, but it will not change the quest what so ever. Even The Witcher 3 had more options and outcomes than this. The biggest f* up of them all is this short montage you get at the end of your lifepaths' intro, where you and Jackie (that you know for 15 minutes) go through 1,5 year of stuff, in a matter of 20 seconds. All those scenes were in most of the trailers we got, giving the feeling and immersion of impressive storytelling, character building and gameplay. For fun (and pain), I watched the 48 minute gameplay back that got released 2 years ago. To my surprise, you could hear the news host on the radio say that [spoiler] Silverhand died a year ago. [/spoiler] This game had a completely different story 2 years ago... Right now, the story is 90% Johnny Silverhand and taking down bad corporations. Ironically, it quite shows where CD Projekt Red got it from.

[b] Gameplay [/b]

As also seen and read from trailers and interviews, you could do A LOT in this [i] then [/i] called RPG (they now changed it to Action-Adventure), even more than what most games have to offer these days. There is no apartment and vehicle customization, no cosmetic slots or transmog features, no garages or parking lots, no minigames (there are a TON of arcade cabinets everywhere and you can't play a single on of them), no working AI (All the NCP's have a scripted walking path and don't do anything unique, the police is a complete joke in this game), no actual persona on your character besides choosing between some endings, lack of random triggers and impactful dynamic weather (they promised this over and over again), unable to alter appearance after customization intro (barber, tattoo's etc), no crime system, street cred system is pointless, monorail and subway travel system is completely cut (All stations were made and are visually stunning, but they cut the part where you can sit in a train and travel through NC, you can also glitch yourself under the map and there is a whole metro system like the map you saw in the first trailer, no wonder FPS drops constantly), no availability to join gangs (besides one that's part of a story). So yeah, you get where i'm going with this. They cut all the cool immersive stuff they showed in the trailers and hyped us up 'til the end.

[b] Game Design [/b]

It's far from decent. It feels like you are in a unfinished Truman Show, since everywhere you look the game shows some kind of glitch/bug. Floating cigarettes, your dong clipping out of your pants, becoming bald because you equipped headgear, the higher you parkour in the game, the more unstable it gets (falling through roofs and walking through walls, the eventual [spoiler] double jump [/spoiler] doesn't hide these mistakes a bit). In trailers and interviews, they promised that you can kill everyone, even important characters. So I decided to kill Fingers, he instantly disappeared and suddenly cops start spawning inside his ripperdoc room. Since the room is so small, they spawn inside the walls and shoot you. You can't fight back, do something about it since the team clearly underdeveloped  this feature, as with everything else. Every scene with some kind of emotional impact gets immediately ruined by bugs, it destroys the immersion. As many of you already know, is that CDPR lied to us about the state of the game, and they knew exactly what they were doing: Release the game in the state as it is in right now and let us playtest and QA it for 60$ (or 250$ for the limited edition). What happened to the time where most of the games would release in a fixed and playable state?


Now the pros:

[b] Graphics [/b]

There is some beautiful scenery and art in this game, not gonna lie. They definitely delivered on a beautiful and unique city. They nailed the lighting and unique lens flare effects (yes I love that). Ironically, the built in Photo mode gave me the most joy out of this game (go to my profile screenshots to see what i'm talking about), and it really showed the beauty of Night City and surroundings. I suggest everyone to try this feature out and send your favorites to CDPR's Photo Contest, where you can win some awesome gear and gaming stuff (to at least get some worth in return hahaha).

[b] Sidequests [/b]

CDPR is ofcourse the most well known for it's beautiful storytelling in sidequests. I actually liked it more than the main story and had more depth to it. Great memorable cast and everyone had their own unique way of living and dealing with problems where you could help them with. But once you romance them, there is nothing to do with them anymore since they will just [spoiler] get out of Night City because they hate the place [/spoiler] (can't blame 'em).

[b] Audio [/b]

CDPR and all the artists/bands that were involved in this definitely over delivered the score and soundtrack! There are even some sidequests about famous in-game bands that really show how unique, and sometimes funny, the music in this game is! Besides music, the audio is very realistic too, where it dynamically gets lower the further you go through rooms inside a club, or activating the policecars' sirene, and it makes the most annoying, yet beautiful sound possible: BRRrrrBRRrrrBRRrrrBRRrrr.


[h1] Conclusion: [/h1]

If you never played a open-world game before, I would recommend this game to you in a later state where most of the bugs are fixed, you will have a good time. But if you have played a lot of RPG's and open-world games, you will have a bad time with this one, since all the beautiful core aspects of RPG's and open-world sandbox designs are absent in this one. Thanks to this game, I appreciate open-world games like Red Dead Redemption 2 even more now since that's a fun, memorable masterpiece compared to this alpha-phased product. I also thank CDPR for reminding me, and now promising myself, that I will never pre-order a game ever again. What a way to destroy a big part of the gaming community guys~",False
"Warning: This game is currently very unoptimized and buggy. 

The story has its moments but everything in between feels like a chore:

· The combat has potential but it felt boring so far. The enemies are bullet sponges and it just forces the player to spam health items. Even the hacking gets in the way most of the time. 

· There are no interesting upgrades or augmentations, most upgrades just slightly bump up stats.

· Controls are unintuitive and very laggy for some reason.

· Buggy UI that keeps moving the cursor around and changing settings, especially during character creation.

· The driving is awful. it is not responsive at all and is very buggy. Steering/countersteering is slow and braking often locks front or rear wheels. Vehicles can not be customized or upgraded. Traffic AI usually works on its own but is bad at reacting to the player. 

· Little to no customization in the entire game. Character creator has limited options. Weapons, vehicles, clothes and hideout can not be customized (clothes CAN be changed, just can't be modified in any way). Character's appearance or hair can not be changed later.

· There is no way to interact with the world. Many small things that would add to the immersion are missing. Can't sit even on a chair or talk to an NPC except the random single line they say. The only thing the player can do is carjacking (not worth it considering the driving physics) and committing a crime, which makes the NPCs flee. And that immediately brings a very broken police/wanted system where they immediately spawn in front of the player endlessly but can not chase the player.

· The story is nice but dialogue choices are often inconsequential.

I think the game has some great aspects as well. The city looks great and the audio design is really well done. However these are often buggy as well. Low poly models and missing sounds kill the immersion.

I do not expect Cyberpunk 2077 to be a perfect game but these issues and many more add up to a sour experience. Not only is the game in such a sorry state, it's just not fun for me.

I could not refund the game as the buggy main menu and character creation alone took me over an hour and I went above 2 hours of playtime during the prologue. Buy at your own risk.",False
Very rough around the edges but good,True
"The most hyped ""meh"" game I've ever bought.",True
"I refunded after a few hours. It's just not even close to what was promised and the game instantly let me down in so many ways. And that was before I checked out all the issues other people had, some of which I would also encounter down the line.

(Disclaimer: I was not part of the massive hype train. I came in with expectations matching the promises CDPR had made about the game. I am also a avid player of deep RPG's and that it why I was drawn to in initially.)

I expected a living world with lots of elements to explore and take part in. Turns out it's just a really nice hood with no engine. Actual wanted system? No. Somewhat realistic citizen AI? No. Car chases outside of scripted events? Nope. Your backstory actually mattering towards the character development? Nah. A romance-system somewhat more developed than GTA IV's (that came out in 08)? Neh. Lots of things to do in the cities, like minigames or resturants/shops? Nei. It's just a shell. To me this is a shooter with good graphics, some miniscule stats and a garbage loot-system. It is not close to a RPG.

Also notice that I did not mention the horrible performance and massive amounts of bugs? Because those things might actually get fixed. But the core issues that ruined the experience for me are things that will take a lot more effort to patch, and I have lost all faith in CDPR. Also there is already talk of multiplayer. Good luck convincing shareholders that prioritizing the singleplayer-experience will have any worth once that ball starts rolling.

In the gaming industry, we vote with our money. Most gamers fail at this completely, which is why some of the biggest companies in gaming are scummy. They constaly screw us over, but people still preorder once some new flashy trailer shows them you can customize your genitals.

"Welcome to CYBERPUNK 2077 the ultimate science fiction experience! CYBERPUNK 2077 a reality staggering gaming masterpiece unequaled in the legendary halls of gaming history!

The world architecture is fleshed out in sensual tones of human desire and wants flowing with flashing images stimulating emotions like the sudden glance of a lover's eyes capturing the feel of a society obsessed with technology in its most pleasure enhancing forms where power to be top dog is the great motivator.

Voice acting flows with natural authencity with many different languages and accents enriching the atmospheric sauce of Night City's melting pot. There are also plenty of dialogue snippets of morality which reflect real life experiences such as Victor Vektor talking about age and what really matters.

Music is top notch especially during combat with plenty of fierce industrial machine grind. 

While exploring the streets and alleyways of Night City i can intervene in situations where a city dweller may be getting harmed or i can choose not to get involved. Npcs including Police react in a positive manner when you help them out in dangerous situations. They know when you have a gun out and will panic while not attacking you outright which feels more realistic. By the way if you want to holster your weapon just double tap the ALT key. I could not figure it out until i found the answer on the STEAM Forums.  

Driving so far does not feel as bad as people have made it out to be which might be due to me driving in first person instead of third person view. Locating quests is very easy as they will show on a little map with a route guiding you there. When you want to change to another quest you just go in the journal and tag it to be traced which will then show you the route. So no frustrating getting lost though you still can to a comfortable degree because of the layered and huge size of Night City.

Graphics ooze with hedonistic appeal drenched in a master advertisers dream come true as electronic ads and ai plaster the city with the gods and goddesses of consumerism. Remember the cartoon will look AFTER YOU!

As for bugs my own experience thus far has been crashing which was easily fixed by verifying my files in the STEAM settings after installation which has kept everything running silky smooth like neurons to a youthful brain with no lag or further crashing. 

There have also been some visual bugs such as one npc sliding across the street a few steps before starting its walk animation and another npc floating above the ground next to a food stand as well as a floating cell phone. Other than this my experience has been fantastic on a i7 8700, 16 GB ram, RTX Geforce 2060 6gb vram with the latest video drivers, 1920x1080 resolution, Windows 10 with the latest update. Options settings are on default with vsync on and max frames set to 60.

A new 17 gb patch just got released over the weekend which has brought some great quality of life additions such as being able to rebind keys which is very welcomed.

The game is not interesting, challenging, or as engaging as an average triple A title.  Measuring it against any 60 dollar game, it’s extremely lacking and hollow.  Gunplay is below average at best, crafting is shallow, dialogue choices are shallow.  Controls and car driving are terrible.  What it does right is the atmosphere and world building.

- Linear story and dialogue options that force you to be funneled into the ""correct"" choice.

- Poor vehicle handling.
- Poor implementation of crafting and inventory systems. Poor overall UX.
- Mediocre implementation of weapons, mods, specs, abilities and attributes.
- Extremely slow pacing; the open world aspect just adds extra tedium.
- Night City is a hollow, non-interactive set piece. Albeit a very pretty one.
- Nearly all missions, vehicle purchases, mission updates, and filler interactions are initiated through phone calls. It's fine at first, but became irritating after a few hours.
- Bugs typical of an open world game launch. Teleporting 200 meters in a random direction, FOV resetting during main story dialogue and inside vehicles, T-posing NPCs, etc.

The good:
- Beautiful game. Runs fairly well on my mid range system with dialed-in settings.
- Decent voice acting. Stellar facial animations. Interesting overall plot and lore.
- BANGIN' metal radio station. Decent original soundtrack.

I come bearing bad news. 
I wanted to be a believer. I wanted to be part of the hype crew. I wanted to hang out with Keanu and do some Cyberpunk shit. I wanted this game to be the end all salvation for all of gamekind. I wanted this game to be the *one* and we can retire from our lives during COVID. I joined all of you at the end of the hype train. My only hope is that Internet Historian will review this game for what it is... But enough of me... This is about *you* right? That's why you're here. You're wondering why you pre-ordered this game. You're wondering why the world around you doesn't make sense? It's okay friend. MacDaddy is here for you.

I won't spend too much time on bugs because the meme material on YouTube makes Fallout 76 look like the most successful launch game of it's time. They exist. If people tell you they only exist on consoles they're lying. Granted the PS4 console gamers have already committed Seppuku (Peace be upon them) and the PC version is not as buggy that doesn't matter. The bugs are game & immersive breaking. Let's talk about the game itself. Let's pretend the bugs never existed because that's all that people talk about is bugs bugs bugs. 

If I could summarize this game in the least exhaustive way possible... this would be it: The game consists of you doing nothing but grinding from one side mission to another. You will have MORE than your fill in side missions, bounties, and police situations. That's your immersion. That's all you're going to get. You could easily clock 70 hours of grinding these boring side missions. 

This is how this translates to me... the developers had to ask themselves how do we immerse the players into our Cyberpunk environment? How do we get them *involved* in the world and to bear the consequences of those decisions? SIDE MISSIONS! They developed this elaborate, beautifully crafted city and the only thing worth doing are these boring side missions. This is their way of pulling you into the world. 

If you get the itch to stop, and decide you want to shoot a few pedestrians with that newly modified gun of yours... better think again... get prepared to have an army of cops spawn LITERALLY on top of you. Every time I wanted to break the linear boundaries of the game (side missions / main story line) I was severely punished for it. The game was telling me this is not Cyberpunk is meant to be played. Why even make an open world game at all? You will not experience GTA like chases from the cops. You will not experience a gradual wanted system that pulls you deeper into the world of the game. You will have an army of cops spawn right on your head and end all the fun for you.Why even have a WANTED system at all if we can never engage with it? The WANTED system means instant death... yeah sure you could bug out the cops and drive around the block and *poof* they're all gone... you could walk into a building, and walk out and *poof* they disappeared!  What is the point of that? I want the cops to chase me, I want a fighting chance, I want to be a Cyberpunk in Cyberpunk. 

But it's not just the wanted system... comparable to GTA this game lacks every successful immersive element Rockstar has going for their games. Why is this important? Because Cyberpunk had the opportunity to not only build upon those elements, but deliver something far more fresh and advanced. You won't own properties in Cyberpunk. You won't be able to store vehicles and customize them. Even driving vehicles in the city is janky and unrealistic. You won't be able to customize your character's look outside the introduction menu. GTA is a perfect control in our thought experiment here regarding the immersive elements (or really lack of) that Cyberpunk offers. There is nothing that PULLS you into your character and game apart from these missions. I can't even believe they're entertaining multiplayer without addressing the lack of immersive features. 

Besides the mentioned features... what about the NPCs? The NPCs that exist in Cyberpunk are nothing more than filler people. They are an illusion made for you to believe you are playing in an environment filled with life and activity. I was convinced of this when I first started playing. As soon as you begin to interact with the NPCs all that immersion falls apart so what do you do to stay immersed? Don't interact with the NPCs at all! There is a great YouTube video showing the comparison between Cyberpunk NPCs and GTA found on 'Bearing Game Asia' YouTube channel and I highly recommend you watch it. 

To summarize my thoughts here... the game is OK as linear questing experience. Side missions will sort-of keep you occupied, and having fun (kind of). It's just a shame you are doing these side missions in an empty world. The main story line is fun and engaging. The cut scenes are great. The game is visually pleasing all around. Otherwise... as an immersive open world experience? This game fails completely. So when you factor that all you have left to do is drive from A to B in an empty bug filled world that leaves you with a very mediocre experience. You'll snab a few 'wow' moments where the city visually encapsulates you but you won't enjoy that experience once you interact with it. 'Look but don't touch' should be the gameplay motto. 

Here is my advice to those of you on the fence... Wait. Sure they'll clean up the bugs eventually, but that won't be enough. Wait for the modding community to get involved and invested. If an open world world experience isn't important to you than go right ahead and purchase Cyberpunk. Otherwise think of all the amazing ways the modding community expanded the immersiveness found in Skyrim, Fallout, and GTA. My hope is that the community will revitalize this game as it was meant to be played: an open world role-playing environment.

"Let me get straight to the point. Everyone already knows about all the hype that was surrounding the launch of this game. Did it deliver? No, definitely not. But is it a good game? Yes, actually. Though the game is filled with mind-boggling glitches, unfinished mechanics/features, and really questionable design decisions, this is still a game with a good story and very compelling characters. The gameplay, though janky and sometimes broken, can still be quite enjoyable (when everything is working) and the game sure gives you a lot of choices in build making and how you can tackle certain missions. Its graphics are no short of marvelous and it’s got a decently high amount of content. The problem is that not all of the content is necessarily good. The game has a lot of the filler kind of side-content you’d expect from a Ubisoft game and there isn't really much to do outside of missions. The police chases, mini-games, and customization of games like Grand Theft Auto V are nowhere to be found here. You can't even customize your haircut after you're out of the character creation screen, and for a game with so many sexual themes, there is a grand total of only four proper romance options, two for each sex. Whether I can recommend this game right now depends on one thing. Have you played a Bethesda game before? Jokes aside, your tolerance for glitches and other things of that kind will highly impact whether you can enjoy the game or not. If that kinda stuff does bother you, you should definitely put this game on hold until most of its issues are fixed, which is something that will definitely happen. Though don’t ever expect it to exceed the hype. Even without the bugs, there are still a lot of more fundamental things preventing it from becoming the masterpiece everyone was expecting it to be. Just enjoy the game for what it is and don’t think much of it.",True
"I have played this game on geforce now founders edition, so for me it goes without performance issues at all, but keep in mind current geforce now servers have following: 2080ti server version(Tesla p40), CPU Intel Xeon E5-2683 v4, 16 gigs of RAM. Game ran pretty well on this.

Graphics is like 9/10. Minor flaws with plain textures. (I guess some textures just didnt load and it made the game look bad),Animations arent really polished.

Soundtrack is also like 9/10. What i really didnt like about soundtrack was the fact there was TOO much of it, you couldn't really tell if you are facing end boss of the game, or you just managed to hit the road with a car.

Storyline until now (23 hours of gameplay) - Pretty good, so far its like 8/10, I dont wanna spoil this to you, so I'm leaving this one blank. So far so good right ? Well, now for the worse part. 

AI is like 1/10. Literally not a single thing works as it should. Remember all those trailers and CDPR employees telling us how every single NPC has its own personality and so on ? Forget it, NPC cant even tell if you are in front of it. (spoiler alert, that's just a tip of the iceberg).

Gameplay - 4/10, there were so many unique things we were shown we could do. Wanna example ? Remember that gameplay of a netrunner they showed us ? (Pacifica you get a quest from VDB, and you are supposed to get into Animals lair.) Well, all those fancy hacks like you can hack guys sparing robot to knock him out or hack guy lifting weights  ... they aint there. Hacking/netrunner skills are damn boring, there is literally like nothing you would expect. All upgrades of your character are just like lvl 1: damage increase 15% lvl 2: damage increase 30%. I thought this is exactly what it was not supposed to be. Unique abilities ? Where, I dont see them. Stealth - useless, Melee - useless, Firearms- okay. Mobile phone - annoying calls you cant even not pick up. If you do, it changes nothing about the dialogue coming up(Hi Delamain taxi, no way another car is nearby me, you just phoned me 201. time today!). Gravity of vehicles - Joke. Choices you make by dialogues - Feels pretty much like a scam, like almost literally nothing changes no matter what you say.

Marketing ... overhype ? I am not sure if i just feel like it cause of the personalized ads, but I feel like cyberpunk spent so fucking much on marketing. It literally feels like they spent more money on advertising than on the game itself. - Shady, dont get it. 

Conclusion - In a current state of the game, I would not recommend buying it. Wait at least half a year and watch the updates. So far, the game is unfinished, forced to be released.",False

"This game was not finished...


There are deeper issues beyond all the bugs, glitches and performance issues.

The world you run around in is lifeless, NPC's are boring and lack polish. The same goes for the general environment, its all very pretty but is mostly fake. Interactions with NPC's such as civilains, gang members and police is very plastic and fake. I stole a car once and ran it into the ocean with people inside, they did not drown or even get out. The police and wanted system is broken beyond belief, this was a design sacrifice not a bug. The quests are pretty good but many things that seemed organic were obviously scripted and can easily be broken. The gameplay is fairly standard FPS RPG affair, its nothing groundbreaking but its mostly fun. The stealth works decent enough, I'm a sucker for stealth plays so it worked for me and I had good times without any issues. The shooting is alright but felt lacking, I also never felt accurate either its the hitboxes or an RPG mechanic. The quickhacks feel unfinished, they lack depth but I can't pinpoint what should change, I just expected more.

I have had WAY too many main and side quests ""bug out"", some are still bugged as of patch 1.06. Some glitches took away from the dramatic moments happening, it was NOT funny. Some bugs broke quests that I HAD to load a MUCH earlier save and redo some quest triggers. I have decided to uninstall the game until its been patched up enough to at least fix the bugs but I am hoping for more than just that.

This might be just my opinion but I really dislike the Johnny Silverhand character, he seems to have almost no redeeming qualities but this might be because I have not finished the game. Keanu Reeves' acting is below his usual standard here, I had high hopes I guess. I will revise this review once I have finished the whole story.

The graphics are very good, up to industry standards, definitely had some wow moments. The sound design was decent but feels lacking in some places. Voice acting is mostly good, during quests that is.

It definitely feels as if there was a WHOLE lot of features cut and some existing features are not properly implemented. It feels like this game has HUGE potential but needs a serious rework. I am hoping CD Projekt Red pulls off a ""No Mans Sky"" and slowly works in the real game over 2021. I do not recommend getting this game in its current state (v1.06).",False
I really enjoyed the game. Although it has issues that need to be addressed . I find my self interested in the story and the side missions every time i play it,True
"The game is not over-hyped. I only play multiplayer games and I never play single players but this game has made me want to change that. I definitely see myself getting a couple different play through's maxed. Also, with multiplayer coming out in the future i'm excited to see how that will work. 

10/10 Bugs - They are hilarious when you do come across them, at least this has been my experience.

9/10 Loot system - About as good as you'd expect in an rpg like this game, one thing they could add (perhaps it is a thing later in the game idk) is a lock-box type of system where you hack it and loot is inside, i think this would add a bit more depth to the looting system as you pretty much just loot bodies you kill and random stuff laying around the world.

10/10 Skill tree - There are so many different unique ways to play (builds) and each time you get skill points you are excited because of expanding on how you can play. From how little i've played so far, there are builds ranging from super-hackers to blade-masters or if you'd like to play like an absolute animal you could run into every situation guns blazing and go down a path of upgrading your gun skills.

8.5/10 Combat system - When using guns it feels pretty standard, nothing crazy although (SPOILER) there are guns that have special powers on them that allow for ricocheting bullets off of walls all the way to charging up the shot to pierce through walls. I find myself really enjoying the stealthy/katana style of play where I sneak around hacking stuff and slicing n dicing people up with the sword. The melee feels great and the assassinations are dope. I am currently upgrading my sword skills in the passive tree, some things i've upgraded are 'Reducing the stamina used by sword attacks by 50%' and 'Deal 30% more damage with heavy attacks.

But if we're talking about the game itself, apart from doing the main and side quests, it feels empty, the AI is dumb, there's no customization as we would've thought... It just don't make it for me.",False
"The game isnt bad! But the way they marketed it and hyped it, it feels like No mans sky launch all over again. Theres really nothing special about this game, its just like any other. 

V's female voice acting is also horrible, it definitely shows they recorded them seperately because her tone and engagement doesnt match what the other person said.

Character customisation is very lacking and basic af, there are countless other games that have way better options...

Genital customisation is lacking and also pointless, might aswell not have it.

The skin tones look artificial, default skin tone was some ugly ogre witch green...

The character you created at the menu vs what your character actually looks like with in game lighting is drastic.i made a pretty decent 8/10 looking chick in menu, and as soon as the game started as corpo in front of a mirror, she went to 3/10....

whats the point of the customisation of the body when you will only see your face in mirrors... because its a first person only game....

Combat is basic. nothing special about it, at no point in the game where i feel like V's a bad ass.

PC mouse and keyboard feels so cluncky, mouse aiming feels like its mapping my mouse input into joystick. theres definitely forced mouse acceleration in there. Walking or running has no ramp up and the animation sucks when you look down. Kinematic technology isnt something out of reach devs... you had so much time...

You dont really control the story, the game may try to make you think you do, but actually its super obvious because the choices are limited.

No flying cars.

Countless bugs.

Map is tiny, and i cant see what the devs claim to be compensated by vertical content. Theres definitely no vertical content other than scripted story.

Clubs dont feel like real clubs, it should be crowded, not close to empty...

Hacking and stealth are pretty useless compared to guns blazing.

Should you play it, yes its Not Bad. But its definitely no where close to game of the year, it should win ""the most disappointing over hyped game of the century""",False

I am hoping that the abundance of bugs and sloppy gameplay mechanics are fixed so that I can change my review to a positive in the future.

The music in the game is also really good. There are enough to satisfy everyone.

"firstly i wanna say this game isnt bad, i actually enjoyed to play most of it, the cars you can collect are cool and the story line has a cool bladerunner 2049 vibe, however it is very buggy (at the moment) and initial release has been messy, and SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!


after completing the main story line i thought the endings are a bit naff, i mean they aren't poorly written or anything but its like there are multiple option of the same 2 sort of endings, either A you spend the entire game trying to fight to claim your life back from the bio chip only for johny silver hand to claim your body and your soul gets claimed by an AI person that was sort of supposed to seem important to johny but didn't really feel any connection too other than they were needed for the end mission and thats it or B you get 6 months to live and then your dead anyway or C you just shoot yourself and your dead rn. because of the bugs and overlapping dialog and phone calls at many points  I either didn't really know who was what and what was who or i didn't really FEEL a connection to alot of the characters ie im mass effect series the characters are your bros and follow you for ages and you really get to know them but here its like you do 2-3 missions with each potential romance/bromance interest and then they text you once afterwards and its like cool I forgot what your name is a few hours later? romance options are limited and there are like 2 prostitutes, also no hairdresser in the game AT all.
some of the perks arent that useful and the whole hacking runner build is kinda pointless as i run an gunned the whole thing just by sneaking and snapping peoples necks or one shotting people through cover with an overpowered tech rifle the whole game. 

also there are fuck loads of mini side missions to do but they get a bit tedious after awhile IE a small group of gangsters will stand on a street corner, you shoot the 4 of them pick up the evidence, job done, or this person has 4 gangsters surrounding them, shoot the 4 of them kill the civilian in the process, job done.

I got into crafting weapons for a bit too but for e.g i could have upgraded my tech rifle from rare/iconic to legendary, but for some reason if i had done that it would have lost 100 total dps? upgrading the weapon was completely pointless?

now im not saying the game is bad i like the game and im sure i will pick it up from time to time when i am bored or when new dlc comes out but compared to the witcher 3 and for a game thats £50 right of the bat i would wait until a sale pops up for it as it isn't as it didn't grab me story wise despite the really cool setting.

I am normally a big fan of background lore etc and although i did read into a bit of the corporate wars that happened before the game a lot of the side notes you pick up are boring and irrelevant to any sort of story or universe that happens within the game e.g. in the dragon age series of games you get background knowledge by reading tomes on made up wars that happen 100 years before playing the game that explains the various beliefs on things such as elves and where they come from, were the different religions and religious icons originated from and how it it comes into play in the current game and how magic and darkspawn work and the histories of different races and groups etc etc etc with interesting made up detail just to make the universe seem more full. however in cyberpunk i feel like  lot of the notes you find through out the game are like boring emails between random people or notes people left behind at work or people complaining there amazon package didn't arrive on time or, blah blah blah blah this is a spam email blah blah blah. most of it was miss able and seemed very boring to read, and this is from a guy that is boring enough to read the entire mass effect 1 in game index lol

p.s performance wise i actually didn't have any issues but i think thats mainly because i recently bought a new gaming pc thats handled the game well. and alot of people online have said keanu reeves has dry acting or whatever but i thought johny silver hand was one of the few characters in the game that was actually cool and memerable.

PS PS. THE FUCKING TRAILER SPOILS PART OF THE GAME!!!! they make it out like jackie is supposed to be your bro and your supposed to get real close with him but after watching him die in the trailer that game out last year I knew he was gunna die when i met him at the start of a game and oh yeah, he dies like 3 missions in and your supposed to be all heartbroken and shit over it but i it felt more like 'lol oh well bye, next mission please'.",False
"Honestly wasn't worth my money and would refund it if I could. Its hard to describe the core issue I have with the game but one way of saying it is this game treats the cyberpunk genre as just an aesthetic for a mediocre rpg/fps, instead of an ideology (not quite the right word but I can't find it rn) with themes of anti-capitalism, corporations taking over, transhumanism, etc. Not to say the game doesn't touch on or mention that stuff, but it never goes into to anything in enough detail to actually say something about those topics. This isn't even mentioning the graphical/gameplay glitches but that stuff is secondary to my real issue. Maybe I expected too much but the trailers made it seem like a game that meant something more than ""yay shooting and the occasional decision"".

I do recommend the game to fans of cRPG games. However, if you haven't played stuff like Baldur's Gate, Planescape, Icewind Dale, Divinity; you might not enjoy it. The game is filled with dialogue and story presentation, so if you are coming from GTA, RDR, AC, etc. do not expect this game to treat you the same. 

The game takes at least 7 hours until you get to the Title Screen and open world part so keep in mind that any review you see with less than 7 hours is coming from people that haven't even finished the tutorial. The bugs appear to alleviate a bit after that point and most i've encountered are visual bugs (flying cigarettes, people passing through each other, etc).

In the end, i just fell in love with the game even in it's buggy state so i cannot be objective about it. I love it, some other people might love it, and a lot more people might hate it. There is no right opinion. If you're not sure, just wait for a sale.",True
"Game lacks weight in every department of it's being. Every route is a reskinned 15 minute tutorial. Overuse of turret and rail shooter segments. Vehicles handle like they are on ice with brakes made of air. Chapter 0's writing leaves nothing to build before pulling the carpet out from underneath the player. AI aimbots you on hard and above difficulty. Enemy netrunners constantly hack you without having a direct line of sight to you. Incoming damage isn't communicated very well, usually not noticeable until it's too late or if you are constantly staring at your health bar. Gear progression is stale and you can see most of what the game has to offer in weapons in the first 10 hours of the game. Tech guns have mechanics that make them feel unresponsive to player input. ""Brain Dance"" segments give players a chance to relax but ultimately feel like they overstay their welcome. Dialogue choices are wholly useless. Upgrade trees are overwhelming and do not make a very big impact. 
The list can go on ad infinitum.

"I ... really wish there was a 'Maybe kinda sorta' button instead of a flat Yes/No for 'Do you recommend this game'.

I'm tapping Yes, but I have reservations.

First, it's beautiful. If you have the hardware this game really impresses visually. The lighting is great, and ambient noise and sound effects really help sell the atmosphere. The storyline is pretty good, and engrossing enough to carry through hours of sustained play at a time. On those strengths alone, it's worth a purchase.

But again, boy do I have reservations.

Criticisms Numero Uno? The ambient NPC AI is *terrible*. This has been said repeatedly, and to add my own beating of the dead pinata - If your new game's AI compares REALLY unfavorably to one released more than 7 years ago, you have a big, big problem. I'm of course talking GTA V here, but most of Rockstar's output in the last decade or so is so much better than this. Flat, lifeless NPCs shuffle around and respond terribly (if at all) to your character's actions. This is such a huge deal because it makes the entire world feel less real. And not in a good 'matrix' kind of way. I have to hope that somehow, CD Projekt Red knows this and is fixing it - but good grief it seems SO bad as to need a rework so large that I can't realistically imagine it happening.

Next, a whole lot of content seems to have been cut. I don't know that for sure - but there are glaring gaps that don't make any sense otherwise. And don't get me started on the jarring early game montage cutscene which feels like a section that had been intended to be played was snipped for time.

I'm also not a huge fan of the music - but I can't really rag on anyone too much for that as maybe it's just me. Maybe I'm too old. None of the tracks seem memorable. The bugs have been noticeable, but at least for me not gamebreaking. I trust they'll get fixed.

So buy it. Or wait for a sale. If your rig can handle this you'll probably enjoy it. But I can't help but think that Cyberpunk 2077 is punching way WAY below its weight class. I don't feel ripped off - but I'm a little disappointed.",True

"Easily one of the most mediocre games I had the displeasure to ever purchase. While on the performance side I had no issues whatsoever, the game itself is a glitchy mess, ridden with crashes and bugs that will take you out of the immersive feel the game was aiming for. 
While I have no doubt the  developer will fix these issues, the game presently has a larger problem. This was supposed to be an RPG, with branching quests, dialogue and deep choices & consequences down the road. The game has nothing of that. Instead, it's just a mediocre open world shooter that fails to do anything it promised even in previous gameplay trailers (if you check the gameplay trailer from last E3, you will see the differences with the current version of the quest that is in-game now, it's a shadow of its former self, even if the graphics are at times, even more impressive than in that trailer).
[spoiler]On the matter of branching quests and story, the only choice that seems to matter, at all, is towards the end of the game, and the only choice that will lead you to the different endings.[/spoiler]
And I really, REALLY doubt they will completely change system mechanics to implement the RPG aspect or rewite storylines and quests to 

Luckily, despite having played longer than the 2 hours allowed in Steam's refund policy (which may or may not be reflected in the review, as most of those hours were in offline mode due internet issues), I was able to refund the game, as I was getting stuck with the same crash on the same mission, no matter wich origin I played [spoiler](all of them require the quest ""The Information"" somewhere down the road, and the game would crash at Lizzie's Bar every single time I went there after beginning the quest.[/spoiler]",False
"Great game, despite the huge amount of bugs, I love it so far. This is like Deus Ex on steroids, not GTA with Cyberpunk theme. Love how much you can do just driving around the city. 11 hours and I did not finish intro because I was busy doing side-hustles. WAY too fun.",True
"[h1][b]This is an Early Access game.[/b][/h1]

It isn't stated anywhere on the Store Page, though nothing could be clearer to me after I'd playing 10 hours worth of Cyberpunk 2077. I've lost 4 save files to sequence-breaking bugs that've trapped vital NPCs inside: 1) the Earth, 2) an elevator, 3) an endless cosmic void, and 4) the Earth a second time. Those aren't the only functionality impairing bugs I've encountered, but I'll hit my word limit if I try to list all of them. I'm going to ""briefly"" skim some of the more spoiler-free aspects of the game while I tear into it. If you feel like any of this is too spoilery, I can guarantee you've seen more in the official gameplay videos than I'll be spouting.

[h1]Intro Woes[/h1]

Despite the bugs, what lies beneath is shallow and unimaginative - reflected most clearly in each of the three intro sequences of the game. You are offered three somewhat tropey backgrounds to choose from: Corpo, Nomad, and Streetkid. Your choice determines which brief (15 minute) introductory scene exposits all your background information to you in the form of a single, doomed-from-the-start quest. This information is promptly thrown out, wholesale, and your choice going forward will very finely reflect in certain dialogue options later on. As far as I can tell, they do not alter the outcomes of those encounters.

Once your chosen intro concludes, you're greeted with a lengthy - if schizophrenic - montage OF THE FOLLOWING 6 MONTHS you spend with your new pal. With Jackie in tow, you pick yourself up by the bootstraps and build not only a friendship, but a small repertoire of seemingly fun adventures - none of which you get to participate in. Strangely, each starting background receives the same montage. Regardless of your choice and what happens the cut-paste montage, you always end up a nameless, yet highly respected and sought after, street urchin with an all-too-familiar crew of people whom you do not know and a phone that rings off the hook with texts and calls from various strangers. 

[b]The cherry on top?[/b] You're greeted with a combat tutorial AFTER the montage of you and your now-longtime friend already doing all the things you'll then be learning in the tutorial.

You could've simply been doing those things to learn the game...

This is the narrative equivalent of paying someone to eat your lunch for you and then describe the experience. And it happens multiple times. Whenever CP2077 needs you to be somewhere for a plot moment, expect to blackout or be bonked on the head so you can be teleported somewhere relevant and shown a video clip of something interesting happening at you. This happens DOZENS of times. Its the convenient amnesia trope ad naus. 

No substance, no flavour, just soggy mechanical busywork to shoo you toward the lifeless and unimaginative world of Dystopian City #371.

[h1]Hell is Empty[/h1]

After seeing the start of this game a total of 6 times, I thought to myself: [i]Is this the story-driven RPG that was marketed for numerous years by CDPR, known for the acclaimed story-driven RPG series The Witcher?[/i] 

If so, they've successfully recreated the experience of playing an alpha build of a Bethesda game. 

Night City is filled to the chrome-mammeries with cloned Cyber-dorks with no dialogue, ambling around lifeless and unblinking, often sharing a walk cycle with anyone else in their herd of roughly a half dozen other Cyber-dorks. You'll constantly hear the same 3-4 lines of ""ambient"" dialogue spoken at you - out of context - by dead-eyed porcelain husks that exist only to fill benches. It's like returning to Whiterun for the umpteenth time and you forgot to murder all the guards so they've all gotten chummy or needlessly aggressive with you - but you need to pass through a welcoming procession of them just to get to the menu that allows you to skip to the next scene. I'm thoroughly convinced Night City is populated only by failed sexbots. No humans allowed, including within the pool of voice actors.

[h1]Things I Cyberthunk[/h1]

I'm quickly getting tired of thinking about this game as I write about it, so I'll blast out the next few points as delicately as CDPR treats their employees:

- Everything in this game has been done better by a number of other older open-world games in the last decade. (Fallout ,Farcry, Deus Ex, GTA, Watchdogs, and more)
- Side quests create a schism between the character you choose to play and the one the main story builds for you. (Nothing is more Cyberpunk than working for the cops...who just happen to be the first quest provider)
- Side quests from the same providers typically follow the same structure (fetch, kill 4 dudes and loot chest, dialogue puzzle, fist fight, etc.)
- Cyberpunk borrows only aesthetic from the rich and storied catalogue of media in the genre it is named after.
- Effectively zero accessibility options outside of subtitles and colorblind mode.
- The menus are as well assembled as those in The Witcher 1, and just as clear.
- As soon as you feel you know where the plot is going, you've already guessed the ending.
- All problems can be solved the same way (shooting) and there is zero reason to play any other way - as the stealth relies on playing in live-menus, and the melee is laughably soft. Both are clunky and off-putting.
- There is no point where you can customize your character once you've birthed them into the world, nor do you get many opportunities to see V.
- Customization is not very deep, though it is nice to see the long-awaited sequel to Penis 1
- Much of the writing walks a line between juvenile or grimdark edgy. It feels like a game trapped in 2007, narrative-wise.

[h1]Gonk-lusion[/h1]

I'll update the review once they finish it, but for now, I cannot recommend it. I'm not sure that will change. The game has many foundational problems like the ones listed above that cannot simply be patched - poor localization, poor line-reads, disjointed story beats - and I feel they're too integral to the structure of the game that any changes would also cause a sort of butterfly effect.

[b]For now, if I was forced at gunpoint to rate the game, I'd give it a Fallout 5 out of 10[/b]",False

"Just horrible

Any normal person will tell you that the game is a buggy mess , with no real interesting gameplay and awful performance , being almost completely carried by the story

Any CDPR fanboy will tell you that the bugs add immersion , and that you should give time to the devs to fix the game you paid for

I wasn´t even hyped for this game and got it for free ,and it is still extremely dissapointing

Newest patches didn´t fix jackshit , just added more bugs like not being able to progress trough a phonecall , basically forcing a complete game reset .",False
"Okay, after having come as close to 100%ing the game as broken missions let me, it's time for a review. I'm not here to complain about the hundreds of bugs you're going to encouter and I wasn't part of the hype train, and yet I'm still disappointed. Before you buy this, be aware that:

- you can't get a haircut, tattoos or any other changes to your appearance. Even cyberware often won't change the look of your character
- there are no small side activities, you can't for example play on the arcade machines that are everywhere, no drug abuse system, not much interaction with the world of cyberpunk at all
- no tanks, planes, boats or other special vehicles outside of 1(?) mission
- no mines (despite them being in the game), rocket launchers, grenade launchers or any heavy weapons for that matter
- no playing as police, medic, evac etc
- no customizing cars
- no storing cars you stole
- a severe lack of weapon attachments (silencers are the only muzzle attachment, there are no extended mags, laser pointers etc)
- the police are a non factor. Driving for a few seconds will lose them. But if you stand still they will just materialize out of thin air right nex to you. There are no car chases with the police because the literally can't drive cars
- no eating food or using any of the stalls anywhere
- no companions, not even a flathead
- no interactions with npcs whatsoever, no immersion
- no factions, no relations with anyone. What you do and who you are literally does not matter a bit in the great scheme of things outside of a few dialogue options in some main missions
- completely broken upgrade/crafting system
- no ownership of items by NPCs, you can just loot everything (if it's not bugged) without anyone caring, which kind of breaks the immersion even further
- astoundingly bad AI, that goes for enemies as well as other NPCs, especially when they're driving
- a lack of QoL features that have been industry standard for years (for example that the minimap zooms out the faster you drive so that you won't miss your next turn)

These flaws in the game's design ultimately make it a very shallow experience. Its only saving grace is the gunplay, which is mostly fun and smooth, and the loot loop, which gives you some sense of reward (but gets overwhelming quickly because it showers you with an abundance of weapons which you'll most likely switch for better versions very quickly).

Cyberpunk did not set any standards, there is nothing it does better than already existing games, there is nothing new here, nothing daring except for some genitalia. Most of what it deos, most of what it tries to be falls flat, comes short and is lackluster. A disappointing, unpolished, unfinished experience overall.

"Save your money, just buy it on sale. It doesn't worth for current state of the game.

Weapon - with all the weapon I owned, the only customization on weapon I can made is the sight and silencer.

Vehicle - You can purchase a vehicle, but damn it all second hand. And no customization for the vehicle. :(

Braindance - You have the braindance tool but you can't play it :(

V - from the start I was a poor Mercenary, stay at H10 Apartment. After max out street cred and selling paints for living, I still live in H10 apartment. :) [spoiler]Hey, I can create a female character with a dick but I cannot make use of it. wtf? :)[/spoiler]

World - All the street food can't be tasted, Clothing Shop can't try on clothing, No NPC riding bikes [spoiler] Well...NPC suck in 4 wheel, so 2 wheel... :) [/spoiler]

Driving - The driving are weird in game, it felt like you are driving a soap.

Cyberware - My Mantis Blades can't climb walls, My Gorilla arms can't force open doors, My Monowire can't do hacking.

Afterlife - There are many drink inside the bar, but they don't have a drink named after my brother.
[spoiler] Vodka on the rocks, lime juice, ginger beer and a splash of love. -- A Jackie Welles [/spoiler]

Story - The main story is quite short, i think some side quest is better than main story. Maybe just me doesn't satisfied the main story, well it depend from person to person.

"The game is certainly worth the money in terms of game time. It's obvious that Cyberpunk 2077 isn't The Witcher, but it may be hard for some players to separate the studio from the game. Review scores for Cyberpunk 2077 have been very high so far, and it appears that the game itself is fantastic in a world where it runs perfectly. However, according to me, CDPR has been rushing the game's release and likely needed another delay. Even the reviews that praised Cyberpunk 2077 made mention of rampant bugs.

The good news is that the game came out great, and the bugs can be fixed over a short period of time. However, players may want to wait a bit if they are looking for a more refined Cyberpunk experience.",True
"Probably the most bug ridden game I've ever played. Has some good qualities, but way too many bugs. They should've delayed it another 6 months. Also, the combat sucks.",False
"I can't believe this game was announced in 2012 and was delayed 3 times. On day 1 there are game breaking visual glitches, the hacking mechanic doesn't even work half the time (there were times where i had to do it 2 or more times to get it to work), and the combat is awful. It feels like they tried to be Borderlands and completely failed. Look, i'm fine if the combat isn't great, but until these glitches are fixed, I cannot recommend this game.",False
"I want to preface this by saying I really wanted this game to be good I was planning on building a whole new PC to play it on (before the GPU scalping situation), I stayed up all night waiting for it to come out on launch day, I watched all the night city wire episodes and I even read some of the lore from the tabletop game in anticipation.

After all the delays I was worried there might be some problems with this game but jesus christ I never expected this, Just about every aspect of the game has major flaws:
[list]
    [*] Combat: only really becomes enjoyable late game when you have a lot of cyberware abilities and the enemy variety increases, early game it is pretty much on par with fallout and balancing is really off with the majority of fights being extremely easy even on hard difficulty while others are literally impossible. Shooting is fairly solid and mods like berserk, kerenzikov, sandevistan and double jump make it a lot more fun, stealth and hacking are probably the most polished aspect and are very similar to deus ex, melee feels very sloppy and definitely requires work. Enemy AI is also incredibly stupid as they almost always stay in cover and will rarely ever try to flank or throw grenades, also with the main theme of the game being cyberware you would expect a large amount of enemy variety equipped with different cybernetics but 85% of the enemies you fight are standard grunts that you will find in any other FPS game. The only differentiation from this being netrunners who will hack you from a distance, faster enemies who will dodge around, tankier enemies equipped with bigger guns and drones, you'll usually find 1-2 of these enemies accompanying a squad of grunts in story missions or almost never in the open world or most of the side missions.
    [*] Main story: is very short for a game of this size rarely has any emotional resonance, at the end of the game characters will talk about ""how far you've come"" even though it only really consists of the prologue, three 3-4 hour subplots and then the epilogue, the main story does have some very high points and is fairly well told but the premise is pretty weak and CDPR doesn't do all that much with it so it ends up being pretty disappointing especially considering this is from the same studio that made the Witcher 3.
    [*]Driving: Practically impossible in certain vehicles and is very unresponsive, it would be serviceable if it was only for one off mission but given that it's the sole method of transport other than fast travelling everywhere it's pretty poor
    [*]Side quests: probably the best part of the game as there's a great deal of variation and you get to know the characters these add around 40 hours to the game and I'd say the game's story with side quests is probably on par with some of the mass effect games. There is however a major flaw as most of the character side quests finish abruptly and the characters involved vanish into thin air (sometimes literally due to how buggy the game is) right after you start to feel any attachment to the characters their missions end and they just become idle NPCs that remain in one spot and you can ask a few questions to. 
[*] Game world: one of the best looking game worlds I've ever seen all the areas are distinct from the clean high rise buildings in the city centre to the bustling markets in watson the game never looks dull and there are some really unique areas which make you feel rewarded for exploring them, However it's completely lifeless. NPCs are zombies that walk endlessly and car AI is ridiculously stupid, meaning the facade that you're in a living, breathing metropolis that houses millions is shattered and the gameworld just becomes a backdrop to look at while you're driving between quest objectives.
[*] Optimisation and Glitches/Bugs: absolutely atrocious, bugs have stopped me from completing certain quests entirely, made me have to reload saves due to falling through the map/ clipping through objects and getting stuck, are a constant cause of frustration in actual gameplay not to mention the plethora of small, glitches that might not directly affect you but are serious immersion breakers and are incredibly disappointing for a £50 game. I get around 30-40 FPS on low settings at 1440p on my computer which is able to run more intensive games like red dead redemption 2, Forza Horizon 4, Black Ops 5 at 50-60 FPS on high/ultra.My GPU meets the recommended specs and all my other components exceed them so if I had an experience like this I feel really bad for anyone who tried to play this on console.
 [*] Sound design: The game's soundtrack is incredible with the radio stations being easily on par with GTA or fallout which is especially impressive considering it's all original music. The only problems I had where that the radio presenters were a lot more forgettable than in those games and some songs that relate to a mission that are intentionally made to be bad are still included on the radio. The voice acting is for the most part top notch providing you get over how cheesy male V's voice is, there were some lines which could have used another take especially from keanu reeves who is actually one of the worse voice actors in the game. The dialogue itself is very believable however there where no memorable lines like there is in the witcher 3. The only problem with the sound in this game is the ambient noise which is terrible and in areas that are meant to be crowded CDPR will often just have really loud music and some stock crowd noises to try and create the illusion you're in a crowded area and not that the NPCs around you aren't just clones of each other playing the same animation over and over.
[/list]
Overall I give it a 5.5-6/10 not because it's a mediocre game, one thing I'll give it is that it's never boring, it does have some very good characters and moments and a beautiful game world and soundtrack but there's so much you have to put up with to be able to enjoy these if the bugs and optimisation issues are ironed out and the game gets a lot more polished(ie combat, driving, NPCs, Enemy AI are improved) I'd give it a 8.5-9/10 but at the moment it feels like a fan made mod that uses the assets of the actual Cyberpunk 2077, I'd recommend buying in a year or two if CDPR bring out some high quality DLC like they did with witcher 3: blood and wine. It's a real shame because with the concept, team and resources behind this it had the potential to be one of the best games of all time, it ended up not even being the best game I've played this year by a long shot.",False
"Well, I've played this game on 20fps and low graphics (gtx1060) for the last 70 hours. Why did I go through that huge amount of suffering and crashes?? Because I've waited 8 years for this. 
My review is simple. Wait for this game to be fixed first and get a decent PC. 
Is the game hard? Not when you get full legendary and a katana/silenced revolver combo, literally nothing can stop you. Final boss did about 10 damage to me in the end. 
I will continue this game a bit longer to experience the other endings of this game but otherwise I have completed all side quests and most of the gigs in this short amount of time with a stealth run through (extra slow, taking time). Also ran around the city collecting all the good armours and equipment and cars. It is not the promised ""300 hours of content and you won't be able to put it down"" that i was expecting from CD Projekt Red unfortunately.

To add to the 6/10 review I'd give this game, CDPR made the most shadiest bullshit move ever. They KNEW the game they were launching on PS4/XBONE was unplayable. UNPLAYABLE. And yet they still let players buy it. So ya, FUCK CDPR. What a slimy, deceptive company. Fuck that.",False
"I pre-ordered this game years ago, and have been waiting all this time, was it worth it?

Yeah. yeah it really was. It's incredible 

I love this game, I think the story is compelling as fuck, the gun play feels great, the world is amazing and so impressive from a tech standpoint, the whole game is. And I haven't even finished it yet. I plan on doing multiple playthrough on each starting point and try all different builds out. Will I say this game should have been delayed again? Honestly, yeah. I've had my fair share of bugs and performance hits even with a really beast PC, but that didn't take me out of the story. Most bugs i've seen are just lil funny visual ones or simulation bugs. Like a car flying up in the sky, ragdolls going to space, in my game a lot of things go into space. I haven't really gotten any HARD bugs, like crashes, softlocks, etc.

With that being said, I still think it's a bit of bad publishing/PR, but also some of the fans, when hearing about the game being delayed, sending death threats and saying really messed up shit to the devs, doesn't help at all. People wanted to get to be out, if they delayed it again, the same thing would happen, and like that isn't good for anyone. Imagine how the devs feel getting death threats because they are delaying a game that they are trying to make the best game you can play. It ain't right. So IMO, they were like ""fuck it, they want it, have it"" and now everyone is complaining about bugs and such even tho everyone rushed them. It's sad to see.

But out of all the drama about this game, it's rough launch (which they will patch stuff out, they are as we speak)

My PC meets their 'recommended' specs (GTX 1060, etc.), but playing on 'high' quality is simply not possible. Most settings had to be turned down to 'low' if I wanted a stable frame rate.

The armor and cybernetics system I felt were lacking and I wish they were fleshed out more. Night city is impressive, but quite annoying to traverse.

"Buy this game if you want a light rpg with more production value on shooter open world than actual roleplay.
Just dont look too hard or you will be disappointed.

Melee Combat:
Ive never liked the silly combat of witcher. so at least this has a much better approach. of course melee is very weak, without a proper depth to it like some other games like kingdoms come or mount and blade. there arent different combat styles or proper tech to it like in for honor, its just limited to a basic approach of light, heavy and parry with no directional damage.

Hacking:
It was extremely simplified from the real thing. this game is a very limited rpg that wanted you to play in a specific way. so you cant get a laptop, connect to a router and use a complex hacking system like hacknet, uplink or hackmud.

the way they approached hacking was in ther words by making it into ""spells"". which was pretty lame tbh. but oh well. comparing it to other games i find it pretty lackluster.

Theres many wells to approach the spells that they could have taken. one way is like arx fatalis where you hold a button and do some directional movements with the mouse. In dishonored each magic is just used thorugh quick slots. and on skyrim you can not only use quickslots but have cast and continuos ones. 

The way you do it in this game is by holding tab and then using q a e to choose different magic and casting it. some of them have a lame minigame but thats ok. i just wish hacking  and ""quick hacking"" were better implemented. The way to fix it would have just to 

Stealth:
ive never liked stealth on first person games because you need to have a better way to predict gaps in pathing and security of the enemies. they removed drones and other camera like gadgets from this game. so to do stealth you need to have hacking as a main way to play this game and let you get a way around them. dishonored did it best.

Not all things can be done through stealth, its clear that stealth was not properly thought and planned out on most of the game.

Looting:
Its bad. You cant loot all of the itens in an enemy, you will though be able to get all the weapons being used but thats about it. also dead enemies are treated like crates, rng drops from them happen, so you will be forced to farming enemy spots and try to get good gear. theres some special items that can be gotten but they are not as good as the things you can find from exploration. im not sure what to think of the loot grind, but one thing is clear, the way it was implemented was to force people into the loot grind which was one of the reasons i dropped games like destiny. at least in borderlands we could just focus on important things like guns.

Cosmetics:
Pretty lackluster ways to customize your character. also you cant recustomize it again later. Yeah, pretty disappointing. even skyrim had a plastic surgeon. no barbers, no way to change makeup or visual prostethics.
Also you are forced to play this game looking funny, which i does not like. So i wear the way i want to look instead of being forced into looking ugly. Terraria has a good approach to this. For each gear slot you have a visual slot which overrides the geometry look but keeps the stats of the other one being used.

Also some jackets override shirts, it shows that there is options of sleeveless and  hidden shirt for those. Wish we could be in control of those. Shop inventory is also rng and the stats of them are tied to your current level and some of the items are locked by your street cred level. pretty disappointing, its like ac odyseey where you are punished by using vendors.

Modded skyrim was great in this part.

Crafting:
Really lackluster. Not only is the crafting tree in skills super limited, but its also limited by having to buy schematics. its really disappointing. skyrim has a better way where there are specific crafting trainers that not only sell material but also can train you for cash until a certain point. At least you can dismantle everything, just wish i could do that to consumables too instead of having them clutter my inventory. Consumables are mostly pointless. Thankfully crafting ammo, grenades and stimpacks is somewhat cheap but you cant batch craft them or just hold the button to keep crafting while holding the mouse button.

You should have either a schematics vendor, a way to get them from dismantling weapons or some other thing like a special vendor for those. If i could, i would have schematics have quality that improves as you craft, upgrade and dismantle items related to it.

Upgrading:
Too much of a resource dump and gear can only be upgraded through base stats so you cant change the perks, visuals and weapon parts. you can only change the muzzle and scope. yikes, fallout 4 won on this one by miles, hope they refurbish this part asap because the game is so poorly designed the most viable way to play it is through guns. Even rdr 2 which isnt an rpg has better gun customization. base skyrim was so much better.

now comes the most aggregious part. Narrative:
I haevnt finished the game, but we all know that most devs put most of their work on the beggining instead of later parts so imma judge it by what ive played so far.

Theres 2 types of npcs, the crowd and some important npcs that you can actually talk to. I will be lenient on crowd npcs because unless they had gpt-3 implemented no way in hell we would be able to get interesting dynamic dialogue for every npc made on the fly.

But the other ones are what bugs me the most. Theres more dialogue and npcs to talk to in base skyrim than this game. like wow. if you compared it to modded skyrim it would get squashed. its just sad. Npcs dont have routines or their own lifes, dialogues are linear and you are locked to them. No companions like in base skyrim, no random interesting npcs walking the world like modded skyrim. Companions are tied to specific missions. and far between.
Even fallout new vegas which i felt was pretty linear had more branching dialogues than this game.
Also some dialogue choices are forgotten. and your character talks without you choosing sometimes. they should have canned voice acting and given more choice for the player. its like the witcher all over again, i feel like im watching a movie and then sometimes choosing dialogue or
Prologue:
Oh god is it bad. its awful. you have a shitty very short mission tied to your origin. They should have scrapped this part since its so bad. You have a boring introduction to the game and then it has jump cuts. like wut. and the rest of the real ""prologue"" which people are misunderstanding as the prologue is so linear and boring. thank god we can in that part just walk away and go do missions in the world during those. It feels like rdr2 sometimes, just some few missions in the world and the meat and potatoes is about recurrent small missions and refresh on the world. is this destiny where the patrol is all about repeating quests forever till you drone the things you do as noise. i really dont want chores anymore but at least the loot is keeping it fun for now.

Activities:
i wanted to go bowling but theres no bowling or any other thing to do. 

Difficulty customization:
Besides choosing aim assist and a bit how it works, theres nothing. Modded skyrim was better, it controlled how loot tables would work for enemies, how random encounters would work, how you level up.

Skill Trees:
Theres no proper skill tree. its more like stats than either getting skills. oof, there are some skills but the whole system need a rework

We have to accept, this game wasnt done. its undercooked and rushed and hastly put together, hope they get the preorder money and fix the parts in the future in the dlcs. its disappointing but i will keep playing it. its sad how limiting modern rpgs are. Graphic foccused development was a mistake.

"Good core game, inexcusably bad port and launch.

Runs like ass on minimum settings on a device well above recommended specs and is buggier than the average Bethesda game on launch day is.",False
"This game as it is now. In the day of release is absolute garbage. With i7 9900k and RTX 3070 I hit 60fps at max on 1080p. The game is blurry in distance. The city is absolutely dead, no interactions with npc`s, not so many options to do. I was looking to just vibing in the city, but there is actually nothing to vibe to. 
Next thing is bugs. If you look in mirror you have no clothes. If you sit on bike you have different clothes. People just dissappears into thin air. Some people dont have legs and some are just bugged into each other.

However, I believe the game play is amazing; It's a loot shooter, hacking similar to watch dogs but better, and a really huge map. I feel it's mostly similar to borderlands which is in all an amazing series.

"The game is amazing. If you have a good computer especially one with an RTX GPU that can use DLSS specifically on the quality setting to improve the image while giving a huge fps boost. The game runs extremely well (1440p ultra, 60-90fps with ray tracing off, dlss on quality using an overclocked RTX 2070 Super and i9 9900K).It looks stunning even without ray tracing. CD Projekt red has done an incredible job with their own lighting in this game. It also has a great story and an amazing world to explore. You will find yourself walking to missions just to take it all in. That being said R.I.P. current gen base console users. CD Projekt red should have just said this is PC and next gen console only. Almost all the negative reviews are from base ps4 and xbox one users. the gpu in a ps4 is basically an old Radeon HD 7850/ GTX 750. What do you expect?",True
"Does it have bugs? Sure. Has there been the occasional crash? Yep. Is it still one of the best damn narrative games I've played in a long time? ABSOFUCKINGLUTELY.

I've had minor quibbles with things (it's probably much easier to drive with a controller than it is a mouse/keyboard, some of the gangs feel a little light on content), but the most important thing I can tell you about the game is that I want more, and I haven't regretted a single moment I've spent playing it, and will gladly throw as much money at additional DLC/content as I can, just so I get to spend more time in this world and with these characters. One of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I've had in years, bar none, even with the bugs.",True
"Oh boy, here we go...My advice: Wait at least 6 months/dont buy for 60$. 
The game is NOT finished, and its not the game they advertised. Wake the frick up CDPR, youve got a reputation to burn.

+ The Story & Characters, voice acting (including sidequest content) are really good to amazing.
+ The Worldbuilding & environmental storytelling is really good (but a lot of wasted potential, more on that later)
+ Guncombat feels good, shotguns & revolvers have that ""oomph"" you expect them to have.
+ Hacking/Stealthcombat is okay. You can feel the heavy Deus Ex influence.

And thats all the positives for me. If you have money to splash and want a linear story experience, give it a try. But its not an open world GTA sandbox, and DEFINETLY not an RPG.
- The ""open world"" looks great, but is not empty, but lifeless. They took everything that they thought made witcher 3 good, and slapped Cyberpunk over it. Problem is that the systems just dont work that well in this title. You still can sort of discover Questionmarks, but its just the same ""shoot bad guys"" mission every time. You still can sort of meet npcs/questlines through this kind of discovering, but its the same thing every time: the boss of that part of the city suddenly calls you (which is a designflaw in itself imo) and gives you more of the ""shoot bad guys"" missions. You even can meet some of them in their respective parts of the city (if they own a bar f.e.), but theres another problem: they are just there. There is no deeper development, no getting to know the character, no more ""talking biz"" in person. They just sit there with an animation & you can ask them a handful of meaningless blue questions. thats it. Go near marker/questionmark, get random call from that person, shoot the bad guys, get the money.
- Thought it might be fun to visit all the vastly different bars, listen to the music & maybe get random encounters ? nope. you still just buy your beverage of choice into your inventory, and wont even sit down or get some sort of animation. Its still just the same old tradewindow. yes, there is also nothing else to do in these bars.
- You cant customize V after the (heavily oversold) editor at the start, and you cant customize cars. 
- There is like 3 actual useful cyberware's.
- Overall balancing/design of gear is weird. if i wanted to play a lootershooter i would play borderlands, thanks.
- Crafting is kind of useless & is kind of broken/easily exploitable.
- Your Character doesnt matter. And i sort of get what they are going for, and i think the marketing wasnt very good for this part. The game is more about Night City, and how it doesnt care if you exist or not. The Lifepaths are ultimately a meaningless 10-20min difference at the start, giving you another way of saying ""yes, but with slang"" in some dialogues. I disagree that there is no moral gray area in this game, but its missing a bit of the weight in dialogue. It often times feels like it doesnt matter what you say, the quest/dialogue will progress in a linear path anyway. I feel like they missed out huge with the lifepaths & the roleplay possibilities. Another point where the world just feels kinda off. I think there is a certain beauty in this ""the hero who doesnt matter"" perspective, but for that to work the worldbuilding is just not deep enough. considering how long they worked on it, i feel like the ""holotape with text"" is just not enough. How did arasaka get so big ? why the arasaka family ? where did all the other corporations go, why is there just one big bad company ? How did you miss out on the massive gameplay/story potential of Pacifica ... Why do i only get to scrape on the surface of the voodoo boys, and not a whole questline ? Why do Nomads exist & why are they endangered ? Why miss out on so many opportunities for joining factions and the potential of special trades that could help/mess up relations with others ? Why telling me that choices matter, when in the end you miss out on so many faith deciding opportunities ?Why are there so many gangs around but it feels like i never interact with them apart from shooting them in the face ? Why is that crackhouse standing in the middle of shiny corpo playgrounds and who are all these people in the shady underground bar ? When and why the government decided that piling up junk around the city is reasonable when we got selfaware AI & flying cars ? Why can i be jacked up with cyberware (which is gimmicky most of the time) and not be in danger of getting cyberpsychosis ? Why does Traumateam exist & why are they so badass ? Why and how does the lines of metal & meat get blurred ? Whats up with the corrupt NCPD and why cant i join them ? the list goes on and on...
Why is everyone mocking V for being a ""merc"" when in the end he doesnt have a choice ? Isnt allowed to form meaningful relationships or any sort of connection with the city ultimately forced on the path of destruction ?

I dont know man, 8 years, and like this it feels like being a passenger in a feverdream. im not sad, just disappointed.",False
"One of the biggest disappointments of recent.

I tried to love it. I quit a few times and told myself 'give it another chance, it'll get better' but I had to just drop it and decided it'd be best to revisit it in the future when updates have been made.

The premise of the game is intriguing, the world is large and breathtaking, the story shows moments to draw you in. However, it feels like a jam doughnut without the jam. I can look past most the bugs but there's so much work that has to be done on the balance, on the pacing of the game play and the story, there's so many features that are missing that you would expect to be in an open world game of this day and age.

The game's difficulty has no sense of consistency, it's so easy you'll find yourself turning up the difficulty. Even on the highest difficulty there won't be much of a challenge depending on your style. Just because enemies have higher HP and dish out more damage has no difference if you play stealth when you one shot kill enemies with a quick grab-and-kill regardless of HP. And then you come to the boxing style melee missions that will absolutely destroy you if your character isn't build to be a stat padded melee monster. Decided to go for high intellect? Too bad, those boxing missions are nearly impossible to complete even if you swap the difficulty to easy. I also decided to specialise in crafting and accidentally stumbled upon an infinite crafting imbalance, basically disassembling a crafted item giving you more components than what you put in.

The pacing of the story feels so off due to issues of game play. There were instances during the main story where I was doing stealth game play, being sneaky and killing enemies without making a peep of sound to then be thrown into a cutscene with guns blazing and car chases because that's what the main story asked in order to progress. It felt so off it felt like I was being force fed a story rather than reflecting my actions in the game.

Some of the story elements are high quality and emotionally involve you, but then progress a little further and it's like they got lazy and rushed the ending of the subplot that completely detaches you from the game. It feels almost like I'd be wasting my time to invest my emotions because I know it could be inevitably let down.

And here we are in 2020 and there's features that are down right awful or missing. Dynamic, intelligent AI with variable lives? I think not, more like predictable, dumb and inclined to respond to situations unrealistically. Police that chase you for your crimes? Nope, just spawn on foot police out of thin air around you. There are no police chases. Escaping from a crime scene is absolutely laughable, just move a little outside the area and your wanted status disappears. What about travelling around the city in public transport? Nope, trains and stations exist but you can't access them probably because it was turned into a half baked execution.

Then there's the bugs, there's no point of discussing it because the bugs are literally riddled everywhere in all kind of actions you do.

I'm so disappointed in CDPR, to go from The Witcher 3 to... this? If time were the answer to fix the bugs and bring all these features up to expectation and more, then time is what it should have had.

I'll giving this game a negative recommendation for now, possibly to change in the future if and when updates have been made and the game is in a better state.",False
The ultimate lure and romance of Cyberpunk is to intoxicate yourself with the illusion of escaping your current life to a future no matter how flawed it is. This game and its whole launch debacle is a perfect real-life rendition of this spirit.,True
"Where to even start with this one... It certainly is a complex example.

First off - Amazing time spent with what was presented on launch. When it comes to art, this game has no shortage of it, detail is immense and all in all the game can be as immersive as it allows you, when it properly works. And that is where it starts to be interesting "" When it works ""

Would i recommend this game to others?

Short answer ( No )

Long Answer - Not in this state, so why do i have 100 hours of it? Because what is in there, is something you gonna have genuine fun with. The world is fun to explore, full of details, references, stories and backstories to go through. Characters within Night City are very well written ( Jackie, Judy, Takemura etc. ) and overall aesthetic is just mindblowing.

But it all can easily crumble due to how poorly optimized the game can be at times. It wants you to believe it's a next gen title, yet it smacks you around corner by dropping FPS on a high end computer ( god only knows how bad it must be on consoles as we already seen examples of ) on top of that, many effects within this game are already a tech used in previous titles such as Far Cry 5 which runs on steady 90 FPS on 1440p yet Cyberpunk for some reason can't handle steady 30 on same resolution ever.

Not even people who bought solely new PC or specific components for this game alone are having proper frames. That led me to believe this is not about hardware but about bad choices in game design where world can be stunning one second and the other you are presented with tricks straight outta titles 20 years ago ( yet the performance does not match it )

So my advice before this hopefully gets fixed - scale the resolution but keep it on native and have fun, there is no point lowering the details as it starts to look actually just plain. This game was clearly built around reflections and without it? it looks like any other game out there.

As for the marketing, it was exactly what i thought it would be - Glorification at max, i never went into this game with hype, rather curiosity yet even with that i have very mixed feelings.

Love it and hate it.

Thank ya for reading all of this and hope to see this game go forward cause i would love to feel the urge to play more.

Stay safe!",False
"The game's launch was a complete disaster. I've seen too many videos of the game where it looks like complete and utter dogshit. The devs tried to cover it up and blatantly lied. 

There's little to no enjoyment in the gameplay. It's a looter shooter, with deus ex-esque like mechanics with light RPG elements.  There is no point in choosing which life-path to start with, other than the first like half hour, after that it all leads to the same place. There are dialogue options but again that's it. So far I haven't seen a single side quest or anything that has ""wowed"" me, like in the Witcher 3. They made that one really fantastic game and aimed wayyy too goddamn high. They're still this little studio, they're not Rockstar Games goddamit.

TLDR: Watch VideoGameDunkey's review for exactly how I feel about the game too


Pros:
- Story is good (Street Kid completed so far, but I apparently made awful choices).
- Bought it around 18 months before release, so no money out of pocket at this time.
- Even on an old 1060 6GB, med settings 1080p (80% render res) is borderline playable 40- 
  60fps.
- Panam.

Cons:
- Plays like it's at least 10 years old.
- Really janky and super half baked like it's an indie game, inspired by what CP2077 
  appeared to be. 
- Feels dated, a lot like Fallout 4 when it was released in a way.
- Looks alright, but seeing people on ultra RTX gameplay videos, it's nothing special.
- Feels like it's GTA SA era, but with some Saints Row 3, in a ""cyberpunk"" world.
- Watching the trailers now after finishing 1 story line, almost feel like a bait and switch.

Never watched or saw anything on the game before release and it feels so far off what was expected with this big open world RPG cyberpunk game. Seems to be the general consensus from people I know too.

Wait for at minimum, 50% off.

"refunded, pretty graphics but performance issue turned me down.

while i'm sure it is not necessarily obsolete, i use 7700k (4c8t) and it is being pushed 90-100% just to achieve 30-45 fps on 1080p around the city while the GPU (3070) lay back with 50% usage,

I give it a 6 or 7/10, ignoring all the bugs. Which for its current price, my suggestion is to await some 6/12 months and check back for new features and bug fixes. 

As an RPG, i find it weaker than pretty much all Bioware or Obsidian games i've played, and certainly weaker than The Witcher 3. V is a more predetermined character than Shepard from Mass Effect, that should say something..

As an open world, its weaker than all GTAs, for at least GTA 2 had a better police system.

The strength of this game, hence why i give it a 6 or 7 out of 10, is the characters and the quests, if you just accept 90% of them will be linear. Judy, Evelyn and Takemura are really interesting.

"I spent 50 hours with this game and since I don't want to continue playing, I want to put my gaming experience in this review.

The Graphics

 the graphics of cyperpunk 2077 are pretty good, the lightings and textures are well done and nice to look at. generally a beautiful game.

Gameplay

the gameplay really breaks the game. the weapon handling doesn't feel good and it's not fun to shoot because the opponents swallow more bullets on hard than juggernauts in mw3. it's just not good. 
driving in the game doesn't feel good either. you can compare it with gta5 when the map is snowy because the cars slide a little too much. and then there is the fact that the minimap is not zoomed out and you miss every 2nd intersection and you feel like a fool every time because you have to guess where to go.
 I don't think I have to mention all the bugs because they can be found everywhere in the game.

 The Story

I thought the story was really good up to the point when I played and that doesn't mean that I stopped because of the story, it's very interesting and the characters are well written.

Conclusion

my conclusion about the game is that despite the good story i rate the game not good. i found it very boring and i didn't enjoy it and in my opinion i would advise against the game. unless you are someone who doesn't really care about gameplay and you play games because of the story then this is a game for you. nevertheless, this game still has a lot of bugs that make the game unplayable. i give this game a 4/10 because it's really boring and just not fun to play and if i want to play a beautiful game i can play red dead 2.

That being said there's also many bugs that i have encountered so far on my playthrough, from those that are funny until some that are kind-of immersion breaking
Also another issue for me on this game is that there's no barbershop or plastic surgery in case we want to change our appearances, but hopefully CDPR will add them in the future.

There is a lot of polish still required, floating objects, frozen animations, and cut content according all the post release information out there.  As such, the open world portion of the game needs more time.

Driving could be a lot better, especially in first person, no rear view mirror, side mirrors, blind spot monitoring or backup cameras in 2077!  Vehicle handing and traction needs to be a lot better.

Good presentation of the main quest and major side quests.  Minor side quests are nice too.

"The bugs in Night City?
Can't deny it - it's all true...
But everybody still wants to live here.

Just around the corner and it keeps you going.",True
"Well, it's a great story driven game, but a bad rpg. Turns out the origin matters only for the first hour or so, after which you're thrown into same narrative. The only difference is occasional (mostly optional question) dialogue choice, and that's it. Seems like they've cut Nomad and Corpo and left only Street Kid storyline. I wasn't expecting a completely different campaign for each like Witcher 2's Rocha/Iorveth, but thought that there'd at least be different context to main story and that there'd be a unique questline for each origin. Pretty disappointing.
Also cybernetics don't change your appearance (apart from arms, apparently), in fact I've learned you can't change your appearance at all, not even haircut, so I'm forever stuck with gray hair which looked black in character creator (terrible lighting not consistent with actual game). You'd be certain that given the setting there'd be some plastic surgery clinic that could do anything from face reshaping to gender change. But that I'm sure will be fixed later, like how Witcher 3 had barbers and hairstyles added.
Other disappointing thing is Borderlands-esque looter shooter mechanics, where weapons and clothing have their own levels (and in fact can't even be equipped before you reach that level), so as you progress through the game you find a better gun every 30 or so minutes. Hard to commit to anything and you're forced to choose between good stats and style (clothing).
Back to roleplaying, you really don't have a broad agency over your character's morals and behavior. He's always that 20-something cocky go-getter, totally clashes with the cold calculating 40-something corpo I've had in mind.
I think these are all of my gripes with the game, excluding performance and bugs. Maybe some more side activities wouldn't hurt as to make the world more lucrative to explore - level designers did a tremendous job. But the main campaign so far is stellar and entertaining. The game feels like Deus Ex Human Revolutions in so many ways, only bloated with open world. It's a mixed bag of feelings. I wasn't that hyped and still got disappointed by some parts, and at the same time other aspects are some of the strongest I've seen in videogames, like visuals, atmosphere, story. Must play, but it's not what it peddled itself for.

Initial review:
First impressions are that the game is a buggy mess that will require much more work for months to come. But, the atmosphere is so good and characters are so well written and the world is so full of detail you just want to let it slide. Maybe put it on a shelf for a while. It's hard to not recommend because the performance is piss poor and the characters regularly t-pose, the other aspects of the game are that good.

It's an amazing game, it just needed more [strike]time[/strike] Polish. [spoiler](thanks, Alice)[/spoiler] What you're getting into is basically a beta / early access, a Eurojank game with the scope of a Rockstar blockbuster. Whether or not you can wait for inevitable patches is up to you. I know I can't, I'm already hooked.",True
"[h1]Verdict/TLDR:[/h1]
[b]The game should've been delayed again. Maybe for even longer. At least another 4 months. 
They couldn't have done that, though. Apart from the obvious crunch the devs were under, they also received literal death threats to release the game and likely were under a lot of stress from their investors, too. All this lead to Cyberpunk 2077 being the most anticipated and most average game of all time. Wait for patches. Wait for sales.[/b]

No spoiler review.

A mile wide, an inch deep. Good way to describe this game.

The world is beautiful and dense. Filled with loads of stuff to do. Really gives off the perfect Cyberpunk vibe. The soundtrack is fantastic. The game is quite literally the best showcase of RTX and DLSS 2.0.

Which brings me to my next point... 
Unless you have a GPU with Tensor cores (Nvidia 20 series and above) don't expect to have a smooth gameplay experience. 
DLSS is a MUST. Anything else is simply not enjoyable. 
I'm running this on an RTX 2060 and a Ryzen 5 2600 overclocked to 4.1ghz. 
Ultra preset with Cascade shadow and volumetric settings all the way turned down.
DLSS on quality and RTX Off. Crowd density on Medium. 
Depending on the area I get anything from 40-80 fps. 
Cyberpunk is a very unoptimized game. Not just on PC. 

Some more examples of why I do not recommend the game in its current state.

[h1]Quality of Life[/h1]

- Walk toggle for keyboard.

- Key re-mapping for certain elements.

- Key accessibility features missing.

- In-game benchmark feature.

- Dash should be a separate key and not a double press of walking key.

- Crouch and skip dialogue should not share the same key.

- The minimap is too zoomed in to be helpful in many cases.

- Missing a toggle aim feature.

[h1]Gameplay and immersion[/h1]

- Body slider customization (height, weight, muscle mass).

- Very few options for some of the character creation features (tattoos, skin complexion, scars, etc).

- Animations for eating and drinking (excluding scripted ones).

- Unable to remove underwear outside of inventory.

- Vehicle customization.

- Apartment customization.

- Cosmetic slots or transmog feature.

- Very few actual merchant stores in quantity and variety.

- No garages or parking lots.

- Crowds have low level of reactivity and awareness to the game world.

- Very few interactive NPCs outside of missions with meaningful dialogue.

- Very few options to meaningfully construct a personality to V. You get to choose missions endings, but not an actual persona.

- Lack of non-action oriented stories and quests about meaningful themes of cyberpunk distopia.

- Player cannot smoke.

- Weapon mods and skill trees largely irrelevant outside of marginal and mostly numerical improvements to combat.

- Lack of emergent gameplay events in the game world (ie: dynamic and random triggers).

- Unable to alter character's appearance (barbershop, tattoo parlors, plastic surgeon).

- Lack of character reflection outside of the few mirrors available. This furthers the disconnection between the player and the character.

- No ownership of items (you can rob NPCs under their nose).

- No prison or lasting crime system.

- Wanted system is largely underdeveloped, with cops spawning out of nowhere and disappearing shortly after.

- Cybernetics lack variety in meaningful choices that alter gameplay (except for limbs weapons). Deus Ex has far more impactful mods that actually change the way you approach combat.

- The lifepaths are frustratingly brief and have little impact other than dialogue choices. V is essentially the same character regardless of past.

- The traffic AI is lackluster and there are too few cars driving around for a large metropolis.

- Trains were obviously cut, even though the whole infrastructure is visible.

- The world interaction is quite minimal. Among items that should be interactive: chairs, benches, toilets, stools, sinks, gym equipment, light fixtures, restaurant menus, smartphones, taxi, trash bins and dumpsters, most merchant stalls, microwaves, dancing floors, gaming tables, arcades.

- You cannot preview wardrobe and weapon purchases.

- There is no reliable cover system.

- Loot system overdone, invasive and distracting. You are constantly showered with redundant and marginally better items and have no attachment whatsoever with your fashion and weapon choices. (Dear god, I hate this one).

- Enemies are too spongy and level design forces frontal assault way too often.

- Robotics and drone control largely absent (outside of scripted missions).

"Cyberpunk 2077 is amazing. Incredible world design, wonderful characters and an interesting story.
Sooo much to do in the world. I just love the game. Is it perfect? No. Is it better than The Witcher 3? Fuck no, Does it need customisation options in game? double Fuck yes. Its just a game. Slightly overhyped but lots and lots of fun.

The game is truly next gen graphics wise. The most beautiful game i have ever played infact. Night City looks so real and alive that i spend way too much time just driving around but unfortunately this comes at a price. Performance. Not the greatest but not the worst. 3700x and 2080ti at Ultra gets me 60fps with the odd spike here and there.

Oh and the game has bugs. But if i ever get frustrated with the bugs i always say to myself: Could be worse. i could be a console player.",True
"Wait 6 months past launch for fixes and potential DLC
- I personally enjoyed the game but it is a looter shooter not an rpg

The game is cinematic and gorgeous
The main story is engaging and fun
The mechanics are fine - clunky at times

It's a great and gorgeous time when things are working
There are a lot of bugs and cut features
The control schema feels like a console port with extremely limited settings - modding will likely fix this faster than devs

Adding a relevant list from reddit:

- In character creation there are premade presets meaning no height, weight, muscle mass, etc.
- Very limited options for some of the character creation features (hair color, tattoos, skin complexion, scars, etc).
- No Vehicle customization even though vehicles look sick in this game.
- Lack of weapon customization. There are few mods to select. But can't customize them like fallout or metro series.
- No transmog feature ""yet""
- No garages. Can't store your vehicles.
- Crowds barely react and have no awareness to the game world. Expected to antagonize them like RDR2.
- Very few interactive NPCs outside of missions with meaningful dialogue. Can't hangout with friends you meet later via storymode.
- Lack of non-action oriented stories and quests about meaningful themes of cyberpunk distopia.
- Weapon mods and skill trees largely irrelevant outside of marginal and mostly numerical improvements to combat.
- Lack of gameplay events in the world. Random cop car chases, bank robberies, etc.
- Unable to customize character once you're in night city. No barbershops, plastic surgeon, etc.
- No ownership of items. No karma for robbing poor NPCs.
- No prison or lasting crime system. The NPCs in game have bounty rewards on them but V doesn't.
-Cant use braindances other than scripted missions (I was surprised cause l like the investigation aspect), and do other common activities regular NPCs do all the time.
- This one is pretty bad. Wanted system is a joke. The cops literally spawn near you. There's no AI car chases like GTA which is weird for an open world game.
- Cybernetics lack variety in meaningful choices that alter gameplay. They have lots of stats to choose in melee but melee combat animations doesn't feel satisfying. Deus Ex has far more impactful mods that actually change the way you approach combat.
- The lifepaths are cut content and extremely short. They have little impact other than dialogue choices. V is essentially the same character regardless of past.
- The traffic AI is really poor. Once you park your car the AI just waits there without even trying to overtake and also often roadblocks itself.
- Trains seems like another cut content. Even though the whole infrastructure is visible.
- The world visually looks really good but interaction is quite minimal. Among items that should be interactive: smartphones, taxi, most merchant stalls.. (can't even have a meal there), arcade games and pachinko.
- This one is critical. Loot system overdone, invasive and distracting. Except to have atleast 200 meds which make the fights easy. You are constantly showered with redundant and marginally better items and have no attachment whatsoever with your fashion and weapon choices. This also means you can totally ignore crafting items.. you can just loot for better gear.
- Enemies are too spongy. Feels like futuristic division overall again. But if you make a proper build they will die fast.
- Robotics and drone control largely absent (outside of scripted missions). Was atleast excepting a personal drone or flatbot which is shown in game.",False

"Revision 1: after doing a handful of mods/quick fixes the game runs so much better it is crazy. Found out that the game doesn't jive with AMD cpus, but some wise man out there had a fix for it and now the game runs fairly smoothly. Still have plenty of glitching going on, except now I have zero fps dives which makes the game much more tolerable. Still can't recommend it right now. Imo the constant glitching detracts a lot from the experience. If you can, wait until Feb when they claim they'll have 2 big updates already done. 

""I'm not mad, I'm disappointed""

It's a No...for now

I have no doubt that this will eventually be a good game, but at the moment there are too many flaws. Almost every aspect of the game has something wrong with it. I trust CDPR to keep working until it's reasonably good, like No Man's Sky pretty much. It is so so close to being a good game. The driving feels great, combat is sort of clunky but the actual aiming and shooting is good. The aesthetic of the game is really amazing, the design of most things is absolutely superb (cars/guns etc). The music is excellent. The story I've seen so far is great (Act I). I'm really excited for what this game will be in a few months or a year, but right now, today, I would hold off buying it.

Not to be hyperbolic, but this is probably the buggiest game I've played. I had relatively minimal issues with Skyrim and The Witcher 3 compared to 9 hrs with this. It simply feels unfinished.

Some issues I've had:

- PC performance is just not good. I'm just a hair under their recommended settings for high (I have a 1650s) and if I set it to high I get 14 fps. On med with some settings turned off I get 30-70 fps (mostly 42-52), The game does look really great sometimes, but there are a lot of lighting glitches. Almost every light source spazzes around when they should be static.

- Character gets snagged a ton on objects, sometimes get completely stuck and immobile for a few secs or permanently. Has happened twice where I jump off something and get stuck to the ground on landing.

- Missing animations for basic stuff. Getting on a motorcycle for example, no animation for it. You just sort of click your way onto it like a lego figure. Another one was when I went to hijack a slow moving car, it just sort of glitched me into the car. Like you'd think hijack animations would have been done, but it doesn't seem like it.

- Once I was driving a motorcycle on an average road and it just stopped abruptly and froze to the road and kicked me off. Tried to get back on and it just kicked me off again.

- The AI is realllly bad, like PS1 metal gear solid. You can walk up to some enemies and just shoot them for 10 seconds without them reacting.
- When you pick up a lot of stuff in quick succession you will have popups telling you what you picked up for the next 2 mins cause they are so slow to go away.

- UI is too obtuse and hard to understand. It looks really epic, but quickly finding the relevant info with your eyes is so hard cause there is so much going on at any given time. There's a lot of extra noise on your screen that is overwhelming.

- If you have a waypoint marked (or have other text on screen) and happen to aim in that direction you can't see what you're aiming at.

- Sometimes have multiple voice recordings playing over eachother so you can't understand anything.",False
Managed expectations upon release of this game and didn't buy into the hype. Overall it's a good game. Was it the game we were promised? No. is it a perfect game? No. Provided CDPR doesn't go underwater over all the controversy I've got faith they'll continue to fix and breathe life into this game.,True
"Actujalizacion:
Como estoy haciendo una larga review para YouTube porque me da mucha impotencia ver a las actuales reviews que son bastante imprecisas. 
El problema del juego son desiciones complejas de Direcion de la empresa Ced projekt y el fin del profit con el precio de las acciones y el beneficio de muchas ventas de juego. 
No tiene nada que ver con la actitud del individuo, de si es que te dejas llevar por el hype y blah blah te creiste que el juego iba a ser todo estupido insensato?

Se trata de que no eres tu y tu actitud, literalmente el amrketing se ha hecho de tal forma que esperabas que este juego era la puta HOSTIA divina, el mejor juego revolucionario de toda la genracion. 

Donde esta la voz cool de los trailers? nadie nos habla asi durante el juego...
Donde esta el mundo vivo y los NPCs interactuando ....
Donde esta customizaciones de personaje, armas y coches? HOLA???????????????????????
Y no el marketing no es marketing y el juego es otra cosa separada. Si el amrketing no se corresponde con el juego no es tu actitud de no haber asumido que eran iguales. ESO SE LLAMA PUBLICIDAD ENGAÑOSA. FIN
La cuestion es, porque lo han hecho? Bugs, missiones pobres, finales malos, muy muy poco contenido. Solo hay estetica Visual, Literalmente el juego es marketing de cyberpunk.



Primera Escritura:

Recomiendo este juego porque lo deseaba con ganas, y mas vale jugarlo y pasar pagina que simplemente tragarme la decepcion, el hype desmesurado, marketing engañoso, y sobre todo la perdida de esperanza de que la industria del juego todavia pudiera darnos alguna alegria entre tanto battleroyales, microtransacciones y juegops que reuiqren de conexion a internet para jugarlo. 

Si vale la pena si necesitabas algo nuevo y diferente.

No vale la pena si no esperabas nada del juego y simplemente quieres probar ese titulo tan popular del que todos hablan. Esperate a dentro de 3 años cuando el juego este arreglado con DLCs y este en oferta por 30€  (COMO NO MANS SKY), ahora mismo es una patada en el estomago mientras te preguntan, oye porque no comes? con lo rico que esta el potaje tan rico de colifor y alcachofas que he preparado duantre 8 años...

The city is fantastic. 
Never seen before such a detailed world - such a realistic city architecture. 

I can easily walking or driving around the city for hours - fighting encounters - looting stuff - reading little pieces of world lore and been amazed about how much love the devs spend to build this. I make the claim that every corner - every inch in this world gives you something to explore - lets there be loot - a fight or just a beautiful view. 

Things are missing right - barber shop - shooting range - monorail in my eyes. 

But judging by what I can play and not by what things I want the world to have too - cyberpunk is an absolute great experience.

Anyways. Multi player would make this game way better. When does that happen again?",True
"The review:
The story endings felt fairly unique, but had no relevance to many of the decisions made earlier in the game. Side missions were mostly irrelevant, as many did not change or influence the direction or feel of the game. 

The game play feels terrible. The AI have no brain whatsoever, and the physics within the game cause them to become stuck, or flop over in a rag doll style. Most of the guns feel great, no major complaints there, but enemies need to be changed to scale to your level. Shooting behind cover is broken. Even though you can angle yourself out of cover and see the enemy, shots will not land unless you step further out. Classes offer some degree of change, but AI treat you the same regardless of your approach when mindlessly slaying them.

Customization of weapons and clothing need a revamp. Attachments felt tedious, and irrelevant. It also doesn't help that you're constantly changing weapons because of the grade, stats, and level. Committing to one gun never made any sense because it would be replaced the next time you finished a mission. Clothing needs to have two categories: clothes, and armor. Clothing should be purely for aesthetics while armor should contain the important stats. Style is irrelevant in the game, because if you didn't equip the highest rated armor piece in your inventory, enemies would feel way more punishing.  

Driving feels god awful. It doesn't help either that the navigation map isn't large enough for how fast you're moving.

Companions are few and far in between. They are both present and unimportant. You have very few to no decisions that let's you support their character development. 

Writing this just gets more and more depressing so I'll end it there. I haven't even mentioned the numerous bugs that exist in the game. At this time, I cannot recommend anyone to buy Cyberpunk 2077 until they finish their game.

The rant:
CDPR did the one thing they promised never to do. Release an unfinished, unpolished product. Cyberpunk 2077 was supposed to be a game changer; a beacon of hope of what a true game should look like that isn't fueled by loot boxes, season passes, DLC, or other monetary distractions. The world of Cyberpunk was supposed to be open, free, filled with lifelike characters where everyone felt different and meaningful. The list could go on and on. There were so many promises made by CDPR, yet not a single aspect of the game felt fulfilling enough to call a single one fulfilled. 

Most folks will say that it's the consumer's fault for hyping up the game too much. Others will say that false marketing tactics dictated the direction of the game. Despite those claims circulating in the gaming community, the undeniable fact  remains that CDPR intentionally prevented game play and reviews to publish before the release date. It's due to the fact that bugs and missing features would deter many consumers from following through with their preorders, thus decreasing the overall profit earned from the game. This game is essentially No Man's Sky part II featuring CDPR. 

Despite everything, I'm sure CDPR will turn Cyberpunk 2077 into the game it was meant to be over time, but it's still a long ways to go before it's true potential is realized.",False
"All in all, the story isn't too bad. It has its fill of good characters mixed with horrible ones. Main story takes roughly 25-30 hours to beat. The main kicker is the gameplay itself.

I recommend getting it in a couple of months when glitches, bugs and the performance troubles have been improved. Also when the UI, perks/skills have been reworked and other stuff have been reworked and improved.

There are no car chases outside of quests/missions. Stuff that completely baffles me.

You will seldom play a game with more soul and rough edges. It reminded me at times of playing Fallout: New Vegas on launch day, though nowhere near as rocky as that game was. New Vegas went on to become one of my favorite games ever and I suspect Cyberpunk will be no different. 

If it’s too much for you I understand, despite the wide net cast by the marketing this is a game plenty of people won’t enjoy even without the bugs. Do you want to put in the work to roleplay a character that is only partially defined by you? Do you want to feel both entranced and repulsed by Night City? Do you want to be not a hero but just someone trying to survive? Do you want to engage with virtual people earnestly? Do you want to feel uncertainty and anxiety inside a videogame?

I want these things and I’m glad Cyberpunk 2077 exists because I can feel them by booting it up. *Genital joke*

"First 4 hours into the game, and I have things to say about it. 

Ofcourse, the year i have been waiting for this game will influence this review one way rather than another. But i will try being as honest as i can. 
First, the game size being barely 70GB is fantastic. Tells you how much they have packed into this game yet fully thought of the consumer too. The game is also optimised in terms of usage, im running it on RT medium preset at 2560x1080 on a 2070 super card and the game is running on average 55 fps. There are noticeable dips in crowded area. 
But that brings me to the next point which is the world design. I was really excited for the world and what will it have in store. And tbh, so far it is far exceeding my expectations. The loot you can find, the lore around, the things happening left and right, and all the alleyways leading you left and right. truly awesome. 

However, the game does lack something. I cannot say that it was rushed, but i understand why it as delayed. I faced couple issues that required me to restart to an earlier save 5 times. I stumbled upon a random event in the city where someone was thrown from a window, the body was placed somewhere but the pool of blood was forming couple steps infront. Later on, the police came to investigate it, but it was placed in another area (could be the police have moved the body, but other than location, the body didnt seem to have been moved). Of course, similar to roach in the witcher, V's car was doing its random things. 
But all in all, its finally here and I finally got to experience it. The game is yet to unfold (as im still in the prologue) so this all could be early judgements.",True
"Hello everyone, this is the best reviewer in the world! It is I, Mike, the one and only true reviewer. Now, let me tell you, Cyberpunk 2077 is quite possibly one of the biggest shitters known to man. Oh boy, I've played a couple of shitters in my day (i.e. God's game, Stowaway) However, Cyberpunk 2077 is on a whole new level of shitters, so much so that it's a wholesome double triple chungus deluxe.

Despite the fact that this game is a fucking beta-testers game that has multiple bugs and random crashes on the same level, I am a stupid based Redditor that will go on a rampage on someone that doesn't agree that Cyberpunk 2077 is the best game ever created to man. I spend all of my days white knighting for this game against cringe smellies, I DEFEND IT WITH MY LIFE.

Now, I want to dedicate one section of this useful review to the main man of himself, Keanu Reeves. My life goals have been complete, the wholesome Reddit moment has been complete, everything is complete with star Keanu Reeves being in this glorious game, a masterpiece. Honestly, Keanu Reeves is the reason why Cyberpunk 2077 is at the level it is now; doesn't matter if the game doesn't run well, it has Keanu Reeves. Actually, the game will continuously crash on you before you can see the Lord and savior himself, but I think CD Project Red are just teasing me. ;)

Overall, pretty cringe game that will have more heart attacks on you and your PC more times than your great, great grandfather, and he's already dead...

NPC ai is lifeless

Driving is atrociously bad

There really obvious features that are missing from the game

(Contrary to others) I find the story to be uncompelling and dull.

Beyond story missions and side missions, there isnt really anything to do in Night City.


I really dont see how it can be done, but if they add in some of the cut features and improved AI, there could potentially be something good here. As it stands now though, this game is a 6/10 in my opinion. Not terrible but not great either. Buy at your own risk.",False

After finishing the game, i can say it's a flawed RPG gem, great game&history. Jhonny & V relationshiop loved that.
Didn't had any major bug in main story aside from some glitches/minor issues, still i can't get some achievements because of other bugs so i'll wait  for other patches&dlcs for a 100% gameplay.

Pros:
-Builds & Stats matters, you can change you play style in many ways, i thought about 10 kind of actual builds or a 2/3 All around ones.
-Sidequest/Gigs has some internal jokes/references example: Jotaro, R.E.M, David Bowie etc. *i liked very much of this*
-Choice Matters.
-Panam, Takemura, Jakie & Judy awesome npcs~
-Good Vehicles collection
-Ripperdocs enhance builds playstyle.
P.S: I found a Gecko & I love geckos so A+

Cons
-Optimization
-Glitches
-CyberBug 2077
-Car physics etc didn't like driving cars so much, although bikes are cool/okish
- Police AI doesn't exceed a single digit of IQ*please patch this*

As it stands i would rate a 8/10 game, I liked the game * but * although I don't care much about the bugs, if you pay the full price of a game in 2020, I would expect more. * but * CDPR has already Refunded anyone who wanted it and is correcting the problem, so it's like TW3, after all the patches are ready, I think this game will be a 9/10 or 10/10 RPG. : ^)

(Portugues)
Depois de terminar o jogo, posso dizer que é um grande RPG com falhas, ótimo jogo e história. O relacionamento de Jhonny & V adorei a interação deles.
Não tive nenhum bug principal na história principal além de algumas falhas / pequenos problemas, não consegui obter algumas conquistas por causa de outros bugs, então vou esperar por outros patches e dlcs para uma play 100%.

Prós:
-Builds & Stats são importantes, você pode mudar seu estilo de jogo de várias maneiras, pensei em 10 tipos de builds funcionais ou 2/3 ao jack of all trades.
-Sidequest / Gigs tem algumas piadas internas / referências exemplo: Jotaro, R.E.M, David Bowie etc. * gostei muito disso *
-Escolhas importam.
-Panam, Takemura, Jakie & Judy são npcs marcantes e incriveis ~
- Boa coleção de veiculos.
-Ripperdocs melhoram suas possibilidades de build.
P.S: Encontrei uma Iguana e adoro Iguanas, então A +

Contras
-Otimização
-Glitches
-CyberBug 2077
- A física do carro, etc., não gostei tanto de dirigir carros, embora as motos sejam legais / ok
- A IA da polícia não excede um único dígito de QI *por favor tenha um patch disso *

Problema neutro:
- As traduções do jogo descaracterizam a obra, não consegui jogar o game em pt-br mesmo tendo um suporte para tal, é legal sim ve a referência a memes nacionais e o esforço colocado, porém os Aldecaldos e outros momentos se tornam extremamente saturado a versão pt-br e recomendo quem consiga aproveitar em ambos idiomas escolher a versão em inglês, além de poupar espaço adicional no SSD.

No estado atual eu daria 8/10, gostei do jogo * mas * embora não me importe muito com os bugs, se você paga o preço total de um jogo em 2020, eu esperaria mais. * mas * a CDPR já reembolsou quem quis e está corrigindo o problema, então é como TW3, depois que todos os patches estiverem prontos, acho que este jogo será um RPG 9/10 ou 10/10. : ^)",True

"After playing all side quests and story endings in Cyberpunk, I'd have to say that it's really a good game with a great story, interesting characters and all in this amazing world. Graphics are also really good that it makes the environment an immersive experience. Unfortunately, you need a high-end PC to get the most out of this game. I was only playing on Medium settings but I could already see that you can get extremely good visuals if your PC is capable of setting the graphics at Ultra.

Despite all the good things mentioned, I still can't deny that there are a [u]LOT[/u] of glitches and some are even game-breaking bugs even if the version I played already contains Hotfix 1.06. Hopefully CDPR releases patches that would address those so that the game can be enjoyed by everyone since it really has potential to be an even better game. The bugs just really make it a dealbreaker.

Overall, I'd still recommend this. After putting in more than 150+ hours in it, I'd say it was still a fun experience playing the game and worth the amount paid. I played for around 2 weeks and couldn't stop until I finished every single thing that can be done in Night city. And looking back, it was a good experience having finished all side quests and after seeing all the main story endings.

[h1] Just a few tips for those who plan to play this in the future:[/h1]

1. [b] UPDATE your drivers [/b] - so you avoid crashing/graphic glitches

2. [b] Always ANSWER the phone [/b]  when someone calls you and accept it if they offer a quest / ask help - as there are game breaking bugs where the caller will [u][i] never[/i][/u] call back anymore so that quest will end up getting stuck (and this can happen in the main quest)

3. [b] Keep SAVING. [/b] Have more than 1 save slot. I had 5 in my game. So you could go back to a previous save file if in case you encounter a bug and the game gets broken.

4. For those who don't mind minor spoilers --> [spoiler] YOU CAN SAVE TAKEMURA! There is an option to save him! It's just not that obvious [/spoiler]",True
It's great game. I loved everything in the game even the bugs. :p,True
"The game is buggy as hell at launch, and may cause you to restart a lot until more patches start rolling in so just be forewarned about that going in. Thankfully the game's Autosave feature is pretty damn generous, and I've never lost any major amount of time due to these issues in my 90+ hours playing the game.

Overall Cyberpunk 2077 is a total blast despite it's issues though. If you love yourself vast, open-world RPG's with meaningful choice systems or if you're a huge fan of the Cyberpunk genre in general then this game is a must play. The quests are plentiful, the writing is phenomenal and the first person combat gameplay is hella fun to use. Even if combat isn't your bag there's also a lot of non-combat stealth options you can customize your character for, so that's pretty cool too.

Overall Cyberpunk 2077 is a fantastic game that's in rough around the edges but hopefully those edges will be smoothed out with time.",True

"Honestly the game is just kind of boring and empty when you're not interacting with the characters or watching cutscenes. Even the scripted and polished combat sequences are boring.  I'm 12 hours in and I cant bear to play it anymore. The combat has zero depth, the leveling/crafting/perk progression system is unimaginative and feels tacked on. Heck even the ""street cred"" is just a secondary type of exp. Yes its a story driven RPG but games still need to be fun and engaging outside of character interaction. 

Watch your favorite streamer play and get a refund if you still can. You wont be missing out on a single thing, which is sad, cause this is a supposed to be a game not a movie.",False

Small bugs that did not keep me from enjoying the game, at most id have to reload my last save, not really a big deal. 
I experienced no degree of gamebreaking issues as other people report. 
Yes this game was overhyped, but it delivered a solid experience that I thoroughly enjoyed. So much so that right after I beat my Streetkid playthrough I started up a Nomad character as soon as the credits finished rolling.
Optimization seems to be required for people that have piss poor rigs, im running a GTX980ti and am able to play medium/high graphics at 50-60fps no problems, nice and smooth.

"Cyberpunk 2077 is CDPR's next biggest hit. This company has never let me down and I am glad to see them not backing down. Hot after Witcher 3, they come up with a new IP, one I wasn't sure I would enjoy since my boy Geralt is not in it. However, I was wrong, that exquisite and top-notch storytelling is present here, and although we are meeting this characters for the first time, some are so well written that I think they top some of my favorite side characters of Witcher like Panam, Judy, Johnny and Jackie.

Music isn't as good as Witcher in my opinion, but that doesn't mean it is average, it is still a godlike collection of tracks that I will save on my playlist, a good mix of different styles aswell.

Combat started slow but I really enjoyed it by the end along with the loot system, I just wish there were more customization options for your loot, like skins or something cause sometimes you can look like a real gonk. Combat offers many possibilities, you can go full hacking, mix it with different types of guns, go full melee, go full stealth, your choice, the shooting feels really good, guns pack a punch and are meaty. Enemy AI could be a bit better but I am sure CDPR will improve it.

The best part for me was the world lore and the city. Night City is one of the best cities I have ever seen in a game, it blew my mind, it really captured a futuristic version of our world and the feel you get when you ride in it is amazing, never seen something so unreal in a game as NC. Car and bike design help a lot to immerse you in it, they also feel futuristic and you notice a lot of care was put into them. Handling could be a bit better but was okay. The whole world lore with the corporations and gangs really enthralled me, I wish to know more about this world, it isn't as good as Witcher but its very close to it, in making me curious and interested.

Now for the bugs, I dont give a rat's ass about console crybabies or people hating on the game saying its bad cause of em, when companies like Bethesda or Ubisoft release their unplayable messes, this people usually say oh mods will fix them so its all fine. But since its CDPR they shit all over em, to them I say keep playing braindead games, while I keep enjoying the masterpieces CDPR keeps putting out :D I had a few bugs yes, mostly car related and visual stuff like items description getting stuck on screen, nothing a reload didnt help. I am sure CDPR will fix em and move on!

Overall, amazing game and a masterpiece to be remembered by for years to come, can't wait to figure out which ending will be cannon and what the expansions will bring. Will make a second playthrough, once everything is patch, all free DLC are out and first expansion is out! Good job CDPR, bring on Witcher 4 and CP 2077 sequel now!

"This is not the RPG you're looking for.

It's an action shoot 'em up where you can explore a beautiful map. And it is beautiful. But all that glitters is not gold. There's nothing behind the shiny gloss. They did some things amazingly, don't get me wrong, and it makes you wonder what the team could've done had they had the time and resources to do so, but this game is just a paper tiger after all. And it's NOT the bugs. The bugs are a red herring as to why the game sucks - sure, there's lots of 'em, and they're annoying, but that's only a surface level analysis of what's wrong with this game. 

I'll just list the good:
Graphics
Characters
Story
Smooth shooting
Good music and voice acting

Honestly, the bad is such a huge list that it's going to take one of those YouTubers who puts out a multi segment 5 hour essay to do it justice.

I Could bear the bugs. It's not something i can't withstand,but bugs are only the tip of the iceberg. The only thing that really is finished in the game is the Main quest. Every other single part of the experience is butchered,not working,or simply absent.

There is a lot of side content, but the bulk of it is low quality filler. ( think Skyrim's endless quests.) Furthermore, this isn't a RPG title like CDPR advertised.

It works well on my I7 and 1070 with 32gb ram",True
"This has to be the buggiest game I have ever played. I'm just getting this out of the way now because I feel like everyone already knows that.

The story is fucking boring and ordinary. We have seen this thousands of times, it's boring. Characters suck and I never cared about a single one. Pacing sucks, one minute you are dying and the next you are buying cars for fun. I hate when games put a fake timer on your game because it adds nothing and kinda ruins the fun. Why would I want to buy the 70 cars and 40 augmentations when I'm just going to die? My first play through I ran through the city because I was afraid V would die if I took too long. Next play through, I can't finish a main story quest because Judy's van is stuck in the floor.

The combat is really bad. The melee combat is worse than fallout's, no joke. Punches are homing and the kicks can almost instakill if you are too low of a level. No responses when shot and AI is more A than I. The gun system feels more like borderlands than the witcher. Also, the throw away gun system makes the crafting pointless because why would I want to slowly upgrade a gun when the next enemy drops a better gun; same goes with the armor. At one point, my guy had a bra and short shorts on because they were the best stats. I thought I could have my own sense of fashion and design when playing but I can't because every piece of gear has stats.

The city is dead. 3/4 of the vendors in this game are just regular NPC's but behind a counter. They say the same lines as every other random NPC in the game. Buying a car in this game is just going to the location and getting in, no dealerships or shady alleyways. Going to bars and food stands is pointless because only a menu pops up, no eating or drinking animation. Ripperdocs are just another menu, the animation they show in trailers is the first ripperdoc you see and is just a quest cutscene.

"The game really is amazing. It was definitely a bit overhyped by the trailers, and if you go in expecting it to be cyberGTA, you will be disappointed. It is however, an excellent RPG with gorgeous graphics, a lot of small bugs, a moderate amount of impactful choices, excellent writing, solid combat, and possibly the greatest city ever created in gaming.

PROS:
- Absolutely excellent writing
- A beautiful city
- Amazing characters
- Fantastic graphics
- Solid (though not fantastic) gunplay
- Solid (though not Dishonored/OG Thief level) stealth
- Fantastic hacking that gives you a lot of situational options
- There's more NPC/Police interaction that I expected, and it's also better than I expected
- Your choices really do matter. It's just not very obvious until you reach later in the game

CONS:
- Occasional graphical glitches/ a rare few genuinely annoying mission bugs
- Keanu IS a little stiff in his acting
- Mediocre performance (some users w/ good hardware have reported that the game runs at unplayable levels)
- Melee combat feels better than I expected, and there is weight to it (though it's only mediocre), but it's kind of awkward. NPC's react poorly to their environment after getting hit, enemies can hit you from farther distances than it looks like they should be able to. Blades and blunt objects are acceptable, but fists really could have used a little more work.
- It's not the second coming of Jesus
- A small number of repetitive NPC models that seem to be everywhere
- The NPC's and the Police aren't at GTA levels of intelligence
- Sometimes the AI is genius, other times it's braindead

Overall, I'm having a great time. The best way to describe the game itself is classic Deus Ex meets the Witcher 3 with a positive sliver of GTA5 thrown in.  That's what you should expect. There's certainly a fair few bugs, but it's an excellent RPG in nearly every way w/ a few annoyances. It won't elevate gaming to another level, but it doesn't deserve even half of the hate that it's getting.

[ 8.5/10 ]

Side Note: There's a lot of people who are in for a rough time due to deceptive marketing and overhyping, and there's also a lot of contrarians/political groups trying to tear at every potential fault. I'm seeing way more fanaticism in the form of hate and adoration than I expected for the game. It's an excellent game, but it won't change your entire existence.

I dont write/type alot of reviews so take it easy on me.

Its disappointing to say the least. So many years in development and what they brought to us is not worth your money.Wait for a sale that drops this game to 10 euros. Around 70 hours i can give u some idea of why i gave this negative review. To start off i've seen many reviews with them saying just about BUGS but the BUGS are least of your problems (they were for me).

The path that you choose NOMAD, STREET KID , CORPO at least for me it didnt feel like it mattered. I started as a nomad, finished the story and now im playing CORPO and id say both paths are around 10-20 min then you become a mercenary (depends if you explore around the starting area a bit). They throw you into this mercenary style immediatly where your whole personality changes after 20 min mark. At first it felt that you have a choice what you wanted to do but it was very little to nonexistant as time went on. I experianced it at the very end of the story of the game.

Your character customization is meh. THIS GAME IS A FIRST PERSON SHOOTER ONLY FOR THOSE WHO DONT KNOW. It doesnt even matter how long and how you customize V because you'll be able to see your character ONLY in menus, the photo mode, and the occasional rare third person cutscene.. thats it you cant zoom out you cant observe V in third person. Npcs on the other hand have cool looking cybernetics such as eyes, arms and legs that you can see. Even if you do have these cool cybernetics that change your look WHICH are very little to none again it doesnt matter since you cant see yourself. You cant even change your hair or tatoos.

You get one apartment, you can't get new or nicer one. There is no reason for you to ever return to the apartment unless you want to stash your weapons which you can stash in your car but that's it, other than that it is pointless. The whole time i drove one which you need in the start but later on you can fast travel most of the time.

The city in itself is beautifull and thats it nothing more. The NPC all they do is talk and walk. They run when you scare them. The Police is pure trash. If you do something illegal they spawn behind you ( doesnt matter where you are you could be in city or outside) in matter of seconds and try to say omae wa mou shindeiru. All you have to do is run for less than a min and thats it you lose you star they dont even go after you.

The story had it's moments but it ends too fast. id say that 50 hours of gameplay was because of the sidequests and gigs. You do not get to go back to Night City afterwards, and see how your decisions affect the world. You can go back to your last save they do warn you that there is a point of no return . The story missions, side missions, and gigs all played pretty much the same way. Accept a job, go in either guns blazing or silently, find something, then get out and accept your payment.

In all honesty if they said that they accept refunds on steam id refund the game and wait for a sale because the state of the game is not worth 60 euros. Most of us expected a masterpiece but we got a dookie of a game. I might edit this review later on with DLC and patches but right now it stays like this. Id rate the game a 6/10",False

"Probably about half of the game in story wise.
Must admit i don't see where all the hate is coming from.
The good:
Game play is smooth on 1080 resolution - high settings on 1060GTX  6gb and i5 8400 2.8 and with game installed on HDD. NC feels scarily close to real life. Story for now i wont spoil to give you guys a chance to experience it first hand ill just say it is a treat and characters you encounter storywise are well crafted you almost can touch them emotions feel genuine  voice actors, programers and scriptwriters did a great job. If any of you reading this played Detroit you know what I am talking about.
Gameplay:
UI and controls are well done for the most part. 
Sidequests even though you can recognize the classic go there recover or eliminate x  don't feel like a chore and fit well in whole Mercenary gig.

The bad: Since there will always be a bit of a nitpicker in us all it is only fair that I also whine a little on a product well done so here it goes:
Even though NC feels as close to a modern city as you can get people in it if you try to interact with them in any way just send you packing with few lines of text that are universal of course to program the whole damn city of people to interact with you would be insanity but  i would still like to hear a bit more than can I help you  and do we got a problem chum?
I am playing on Hard dificulty: Even simple encounters cant end up in death if you charge blindly in and i did so countless times which is in itself good thing. However in some missions especialy for NCPD you can just walk around the flank unmolested  then sneak in from behind and start hacking away (playing melee build) on unsuspecting criminals and probably get 2 or 3 of them before rest even realize that you are there. I feel AI in those instances should be bit more responsive on sudden dismemberment of their allies.

"Original review, written after about 20 hours of game time:
Definitely recommended.

Updated three times, after 80 and 110 hours + at the end, 121 hours into the game:
This is one of the best games I have played. Probably not ever, but definitely in the last few years to a decade. The story is solid, the gameplay elements are solid, the setting is solid, the atmosphere is solid and the graphics.. even on my 5 year old PC it varies between awesome and jaw dropping with a perfectly playable FPS... (subjective opinion)

Full disclosure though: if you are sensitive to minor issues, like animation glitches, sound glitches or the likes, I recommend to wait a few more patches, probably a DLC or two for the game to be ""fixed"". They are not game breaking mind you, I am having a blast, but they are noticeable.. so if those break it for you, you have been warned.. otherwise, you will have a blast.

Some more details from the original review:
Technical:
If you do not use ray-tracing, the game actually runs well on high-ultra settings in 1440p even on a 1080FE. I have not actually measured FPS, but I can tell you this: I have not really felt a stutter or degradation in my experience.

Gameplay wise:
It is awesome. The game has so much content, that after 20+ hours of actively chasing quests, I have yet to make any real progress in my main quest line. The gun-play is fun, though at times enemies feel bullet spongy, which is a bit against Cyberpunk canon, where shots are supposed to be more lethal. Cybernetics are done in a way that blends into the game really well. There is somewhat scary about hunting cyber psychos with superhuman evasion, dodging your bullets like Neo from the matrix. :) The hacking in the game is also meaningful and blends well into the whole game-play.

My first real gripe with the game is the GTA-esque vehicle physics, where they seem to have too much mass compared to world object and they pretty much handle like speedboats on water. The other is the inventory system. For a game that focuses so much on looting everything around you, the inventory system would really need some beefing up to make it easier to manage. It is not horrible, but far from being great either.

There were some funny glitches I have observed and the enemy AI is not particularly smart at times either, especially if you ""exploit"" their easy to spot weaknesses, however at that point, it is more on you than on the game. If you play the game straight, the AI will pose a sufficient enough challenge and you will die if you are careless. :)

The game does a good job with auto saving and the save-load mechanism is actually quite well done and easy to manage.

When it comes to the RPG elements, I cannot yet tell how much of the dialogues have meaningful consequences behind them on the long run, but the world is full of lore and tidbits of info, either funny or just interesting that you can find in all kinds of places.

Overall, I tend to call this GTA: Night City or GTA: Cyberpunk ed. It of course has substantially more RPG elements, like attributes and perks and more dialogues with NPCs, but at its core, the game plays and feels like a GTA game would and with you mostly running or driving around in a big city, I think you will agree it feels very similar :) 

This is not a bad thing though, GTAs are great in their own right and Cyberpunk takes that formula to the next level through its unique setting and RPG elements.

UPDATE @ 80 hours
Still going strong, I reckon I am at about 2/3 of the content now :) At least that is my guess based on the remaining map markers. The story in the game is extremely good. Even the side gigs have variety to them in how you approach the problems they present.
- 1 CTD at around the 65 hour mark, graphics crash. Apart from that, rock solid.

UPDATE @ 110 hours
I am through with the gigs and crime events :) now its only the side missions and the main story left. Did a count, done more than 200 quests (gigs, side jobs or other activities) so far. Man there are some good stories in this game.
- Got 1 weird graphical glitch after an accidental windows update past the 1.05 patch (power outage forced my PC to restart, allowing windows to ninja-update on me). Driver update fixed it though. No hard tech issues since the freak CTD I had earlier.
- Noticed some strange sound artifacts as well lately, as in: sounds getting stuck.. reloading or quitting and reloading usually fixes it. Not frequent mind you, I think I have encountered it twice so far overall and only really noticed it the one time, as it was a very strong music sequence that got stuck on a loop :)

Final Entry @121 hours later:
I am done. The game is a masterpiece of storytelling. I didn't realize until the end how much the story got me, but it actually brought tears into my eyes when I finished. A fitting end to an epic and awesome story.
The variety in endings and how many of the things you do throughout the game influences them in subtle, yet meaningful ways is actually kinda awesome.

It has been a miracle for me to finish the game at all, as I almost never have the patience to play a story based game for this long, let alone replay them, but I can tell you this: if there is ever a story based game I would consider replaying, it is this one, just to see how I can make the story take a different shape.

"Cyberpunk 2077 is an amazing RPG experience, with perfect sound design, exquisite gunplay and extensive customization options for both your character sheet and visuals. It is the game we were all waiting for and a true thing of beauty, I rate Cyberpunk 2077 a 9 out of 10. It is the best story you will play in 2020, and probably in 2021 as well, Cyberpunks plot will stay with you for a long time and the wait for a DLC had never been so long, but its extreme issues at launch made it turn sour for a lot of people and even though I personally think this was the best experience I had with a game this year, I cannot give it a perfect score, when other games achieved so much with much less.

2020 was a hard year for everyone, especially Polish developers struggling against time and hype, but consider playing Cyberpunk 2077 even if you have to wait for the patches that will come over the next two months. This game may not be perfect, but it is an experience that will never fade away...

"[b]Intro:[/b]
Cyberpunk 2077 is a great story bundled with an incomplete game. You can see the massive amount of effort that has been put into the world and its story. Unfortunately, it’s under-cooked. As much as executive and the fans didn’t want to wait, this chook could have used more time in the oven.

Still tastes okay. Could taste a [i]lot[/i] better.

Warning: If you do buy it, do yourself a favour and avoid anything that is not specifically labelled as a “Main Job” or “Side Job”. If you do that, then you’ll have a great time.


[b]Visual:[/b]
With a GTX 1070 and an i7-6700k, I find my settings sit somewhere just above medium. Without using a FPS counter, I perceived very few stutters or clear visual lag. The only occasion where I experienced this was in the rural areas from a fresh load following patch 1.05. Even with these settings, the world still looks amazing.

The world has been designed with breathtaking detail and sense of scale – not only is each district unique, but there are also countless details to get lost in. Even the interiors of buildings are detailed and interesting to look at. Regrettably, the game rarely encourages you to bask in these scenes. You will gloss over details as you rush yet another gig or encounter. Sadly, gameplay discourages you from appreciating the monumental level of detail.

Character models are fantastic, with story-based NPCs showing a wide range of facial expressions. Clothing, vehicles and weapons are all pleasant to look at, with the later having smooth animations during use. Lighting is fantastic when you do notice it - interiors are lit with the glow from computers and neon lights. Certain NPCs also bring this to life: Maelstrom eyeware will cause lens flares that change based on angle and the hub of the Voodoo Boys almost looked otherworldly. Sadly, these moments are few and far between.


[b]Audio:[/b]
The game sounds amazing, albeit not very memorable. Audio design and quality is definitely top notch. But unlike The Witcher III, I found the soundtrack utterly forgettable. Given how much effort was put into it, I cannot recall any tracks alongside standout moments. The radio is also restricted exclusively to the car where I often found it muffled almost below any ambient sound – even when at max volume. You never really get a chance to enjoy it.

Voice acting is top notch, with the various actors doing an amazing job. As with CDPR’s previous games, the voice acting is the standout for me. 


[b]Gameplay:[/b]
Okay. You’ve heard it thousands of times. You know what I’m about to say.

It’s okay. Kinda meh. 

Oh, you were expecting me to say bugs? Yeah, they’re there. I personally haven’t had many beyond the launch day physics issues and some issues with triggers. Those of us on PC are the lucky ones.

My main issue with the game is with the core gameplay. Gunplay and melee are serviceable and cover largely works. I run a build using rifles, Gorilla Arms and Sandevistan (slows time) on hard. Once you get your core build running, the encounters become trivial. Prior to this, you just pop heads with whatever you have.

You do take damage very quickly and can find yourself dropping hard and fast. Although I like this, I found the utter lack of visual and audio feedback an annoyance. I’d like to know that I’m taking hits before I’m down to 20% health and that last shot hits me.

Although it all works, it quickly becomes bland. I found myself driven to engage in the core story because the side content became so bloody boring. It’s all the same ‘kill everyone and loot the chest’, with the occasional ‘escort the NPC to the car after killing everyone’. Given just [i]how much[/i] side content there is, I was hoping that there might be more variety in the gameplay design for this content. Or just less [i]overall[/i] content.

Hacking is a letdown. Breaching is a repetitive mini-game and quick hacks involve spending a resource (RAM). While useful, it is shallow and entirely avoidable. I’d rather have my Sandevistan and slow time. Even stealth becomes trivial when you run faster than people can see. Don’t expect a hacker/netrunner build to be some cool variation in playstyle.

Be warned, the AI is braindead. It simply exists to make the world seem populated and to give you something to shoot at. It will shoot at you, rush you and move between cover. That's it. Even then, it will snag on obstacles regularly. 

Lethal/non-lethal is a choice with little to no consequence. Being able to go non-lethal occasionally offers greater rewards with certain side content. Speaking of: 

So much of the side content’s story seems to be connected to diary logs. After 200 entries, I became utterly detached from the setting. If I wanted to spend hours reading lore, I’d read my old CP2020 source books.

Overall, the controls handle well. Cars can be a bit sloppy and the car camera hates PC controls, but otherwise I found no real issues with how my character handled. 


[b]Story:[/b]
Okay. I’ve saved the best for last. This is the part of the game that I [i]can[/i] recommend. As with the Witcher series, CDPR have shown that they know how to deliver great and memorable stories.

The story provides impressively voiced and animated characters along with enough choices to make you stop and consider the consequences further down the line. Main story missions and major side quests are well constructed and are engaging. These are the parts of the game that are undeniably fun. I found myself wanting to get to know the characters better and wanting more.

The plot itself allows for V to develop as a character. You find yourself comparing the start to the present and realising that you have had genuine opportunities to feel like V has grown and you have been the major influencing factor. Realistically, this is the result of well written and intelligent story design rather than your genius interpretation of multiple choice answers, but you will feel ownership. You will feel that you have been on a journey.

This is what I love about CDPR’s writing. You find yourself swept up in an engrossing ride and don’t want it to end. But when it does, you actually feel satisfied. You also want to do it again and try other choices (without maintaining a pool of poorly labelled and organised save files). Mercifully, Cyberpunk encourages multiple play throughs thanks to its length. The core story should only last you 25-50 hours, depending on how much side content you do to help level and finance yourself. 

I did find moments in non-romanceable side quests where CDPR nailed the tone of the world. It’s dark and there are rarely winners, just people who lose less. When there is a win, it’s only because something has been taken from someone else.

Unfortunately, there is a lot of basic quest design bundled with these moments. The thing that makes them stand out is that you are being [b]shown[/b] the world; you are being given experiences. You are not reading some bloody diary entry or email. I wish that CDPR had taken this approach with more of the side quests instead of taking the lazy way out. 


[b]Final Thoughts:[/b]
Will you get your money’s worth from time spent? Yes. Is the story worth it? Definitely. Does it live up to the hype and marketing? Hell no. Does it still need work? Yep. Will it get that work? History points to “yes”.

Cyberpunk 2077 is the definition of an unpolished gem. It has immense value, but it needs work for people to be able to readily see it. But, it is there.

Sadly, I cannot bring myself to recommend the game since I have spent more of my sixty hours encountering bloat and poor design than enjoying the actual story. Looking at the map and journal, I can see maybe three to five hours of decent side quests and a solid twenty to thirty of bloat remain for me.",False
"The good vastly outweighs  the bad. So yeah, it was worth it.",True
"Cyberpunk 2077 is the epitome of ""Style over Substance""

In 4 hours of playing, I've listened to a book's worth of expository dialogue, walked around enormous (and beautiful) city areas, and obsessed over what my character's hair looks like.  It's vaguely entertaining stuff, but I'm struggling to think of a single thing that is really gripping me.

V lives in an enormous apartment complex, and the first thing I did was try to pick the lock on someone's door so I could break in and loot their shit.  It quickly hit me that the *only apartment you can enter is your own*.  

So why does this area need to be so large, then?

I spent 30 minutes running from one end of it to the other and the only exciting thing I saw along the way were some people lifting weights.  It feels like the game is screaming at you : ""Look at all of this !!!"" "" Aren't you impressed with how much STUFF we have?!""  The problem is, none of it is interactive, and none of it matters.

It's all window dressing. 

Compared to the smaller, but fully interactive areas you find in the Deus Ex series, Cyberpunk comes across like a flashier, but considerably more shallow experience.  

And then there's the performance. 

On a GTX 3090 with a Ryzen 5950x CPU  I'm frequently dipping into the 50s in 1080 ultra settings.   I have no idea how they managed to optimize this game so badly, but it feels like there should have been more focus on limiting the size of the areas and how many characters are in them at once.  

Does the game really need 100s of characters milling around at once if the only thing you can do with them is press a button to hear them speak one of two lines of repetitious dialogue?

I'll update this review as I play more, but my initial feeling is that this game got way out of scope, and became a victim of its own ambition.

Less is more , CD Projekt :|",False
"TDLR at the Bottom.

Fair Warning:
Do not hate on the game in its current state without the ""Day 1 Patch"" Any issues you have, 90% of them will be ironed out, fixed, tweaked, etc. The game IS Playable and Enjoyable in its current state. 

As of my current hours, take it with a grain of salt. May update this as time goes on. 

Initial Thoughts:
The game is amazing. City feels alive, Graphics look great even at the lower settings, Controls and Mechanics feel a bit like Fallout 4, but in their own special, much better way. Voice acting, animations, even small details down to emotions and labels on soda cans are great. 
Anyone who loves big skill trees and customization of stats and attributes, you'll have a great time, as it is pretty sizable, and very open to whatever you wanna do. Nooot quite as big as Path of Exile or Skyrim, buuut different game. 

I'll confidently say it was worth the 60$, and 90-95% worth the wait. There are a few small issues like Graphical glitches, audio cuts or glitches, and aiming in a moving vehicle is a pain. The only Big issue i've found is not being able to Crouch while in a conversation with someone. Ctrl is Hold Crouch, C is Toggle Crouch. If you're in a convo, C is Skip in convo, and Ctrl doesn't work. 

Performance:
As I am typing this, I'm updating my drivers, which are only a month or so outdated, so keep that in mind.
My game on Low-Medium Settings with a few things on High/Max runs at 45-65fps, fairly consistent at 50-55 fps.
I have: 16GB Ram
i7-4790K @ 4.00GHz  Not Overclocked
GTX 1070ti
600W PSU
With these parts, I'm just above the ""Recommended High"" system specs released by CDPR. 

Overall, I'm happy with the game, I expect to see it get better as time goes on, fixed up, tweaked, more content, and with hope, Mods. My view may change, but I'll be trying to complete the story and all side quests as they pop up, after i mess around with the Citizens and Police of Night City. 


TLDR: Game is great as is, definitely worth 60$, If you have issues, wait for patches, update your drivers, and if all else fails, refund, and move on, or Upgrade your system. 

Enjoy the game, make the most of the side quests and city, and Have a Wonderful Day. Stay safe!

"It is a decent game, but that's the thing, its just decent. In the beginning you are like ""OH WOW ALL THE THINGS"", but later on it gets, eh. It gets repetitive, boring and the ending even left me with a feeling of dissatisfaction and apathy. 

Look, everyone bashed CD Project for this one already, but lets be honest. It was not worth the hype, this game is a shell of what it could have been. So many things they removed, and terribly at that. Things that I can see there was a plan, but they didn't even have the decency to remove the objects and entities entirely, just leave it in there, hopefully our player base wont see it.

It drops the framerate way too much to ever be worth justifying and the game looks stellar without it on and everything else maxed instead.

It's badly in need of a patch to affect QoL, glitches, and other issues.",True
"For as complex the developers told us this game would be, it's actually quite underwhelming. Despite the bugs, the core of this game is not any better than any single player game in the past. It lacks a load of features that would make the game feel more complete such as a subway system, customizable cars, more weapons. The list is endless. Until bugs are removed and the game feels more complete, I cannot recommend this game.

I will admit, the game is immersive and fun, but not what the consumer expected. There are quite a few immersive breaking mechanics as well. Stopping to loot mid stealth mission, or picking up other various items laying around can break the immersive feel the story gives. Not only that, but most loot is irrelevant. The crafing system at this point is irrelevant, and most loot just takes up space you don't need. 

Its also quite disappointing that your dialouge choices do not affect anything within the story of the game. It only affects the dialouge you are currently in. That also leads to the sad fact that there is only 4 different endings. The freedom within the story is not as what I thought, yet I am not disappointed with it because it was still fun. 

Do not get me started on A.I., including police A.I. This turned me away from the game as well. 

TL;DR this game is fun, the bugs will get cleaned, although I would not consider it anything special as we all hoped for. It feels like another single player game with missing features.

I happen to find the game enjoyable and entertaining. The character creation is fun as hell, the story is interesting, and the characters are well developed. There are some bugs but none that have ruined the game for me.

"If I didn't accidentally leave the game on past the 2 hours marks, I would have refunded this.  
The game has a really beautiful world and characters, but it's full of bugs.  The AI is one of the worst NPC AI you will find in any modern game. Seriously, GTA IV was more advanced than this game. 
Police spawn right behind you if you do anything.
Driving feels awful, specially bikes. Which sucks, because this game has a very beautiful world, but exploring that world is not that enjoyable.
No flying cars. No metros. Enemies are bullet sponges. NPCs don't have routine as advertised, in fact they just disappear if you turn your view around..

"[h1]Cyberpunk? More like Cyberpunk'd![/h1]

10+ years I've been on Steam, never had I felt the need to leave a bad review on a game...until now (Yes, I pre-ordered DayZ and not even after that shit show I felt the need to leave a bad review which should give you an idea how bad Cyberpunk really is a whole month after release). 

Let's forget for a moment I was pretty much brought up in the whole Cyberpunk ethos. Let's forget I ate Blade Runner for breakfast, Syndicate for lunch and Akira for tea as a kid.

When CD Projekt Red - of Witcher fame - said they were picking up Cyberpunk for their next major game release - an RPG at that - of course I was excited. Calm and collected I skilfully avoided all the pre-release crap, all the hype trains, the news reports of over-worked, exploited developers and every pundit that tried to predict what was going to happen after release or what sort of product we were getting. Could barely avoid the Keanu Reeves adverts as they were plastered everywhere I looked.

I patiently waited 6 days until after release, carefully weighed my options and even in light of the infamous reviews on console I decided to dive in and pay full price for this game (against my previous best judgement of waiting for a GOTY edition with all DLCs as I have done with previous CDPR releases). Being a PC gamer I wouldn't be as badly affected by what was by now clearly a very buggy release - I thought-, but CDPR have been there before namely with The Witcher series and they have pulled through and delivered some of the best gaming experiences I have memory of. So I was looking forward to this as I installed it...

Now don't get me wrong: some of the magic is there. The first time you go through one of the pre-scripted prologues or the first time you lay eyes on Night City there is room for some proper magical gaming moments.

However this is where the magic stops with this game...all its worth just goes as far as the pretty graphics will carry it. A bit like Night City once you look past the veneer it is an ugly, wretched, hollow beast. I should have seen the writings on the wall when in the prologue missions I start getting glitched essential NPCs teleporting all over the place, flashing UIs and janky overlapping conversations. 

I should have asked for a refund when I noticed the AI vehicles were driving on rails and so were all the pedestrians.

I should definitely have not given CDPR the benefit of doubt when I decided to step outside the boundaries of scripted quests for just one second and started noticing very odd pop-ins, police teleportation and a lack of content in general.

From there it goes downhill very quickly. As the story develops so does the intensity of the bugs and glitches: I mean, from random spawning flying cars (yes, even on 1.05), to having random NPCs glide through main NPCs during story conversations, to having to restart the game and reload missions endlessly because the input stops responding (mouse and keyboard, the most basic you can get on a PC), to drawing a weapon during a climatic car chase only to have the main character's hands show up empty with a pointing finger leading to me getting shot and dying...to the vast open emptiness that is the game world once you break free of the scripted boundaries of quests and side quests.

This is a supposed open-world RPG (even if they are now trying to class it as ""action/adventure"" after spending years saying it would be an RPG) where if you step outside the rigid walls of the pre-determined storylines you are faced with nothing: gangs and NPCs will not interact with you even after you've butchered their members 30 seconds before; police will spawn behind you and one shot you but if you run and hide for 30 seconds all is forgiven and the police doesn't even know who you are; shopkeepers are clearly just a placeholder work in progress item; customization is non-existant beyond the character creation screen; even though you are 90% recognisable according to this Legend of the Afterlife status no one knows who you are...the list is too long to enumerate here.

But the bugs and glitches are only the tip of the iceberg - the ""choices"" you are given have little to no impact on how the world reacts and interacts with you, the storylines are all on rails, you have no real choice. It is not an open-world futuristic RPG but an adventure game on rails without any soul to it (think Deus Ex but the 2nd one with all the promises it made but unable to surpass all the issues and limitations it had from the start).

[strike]On top of it the posture CDPR have shown when confronted with the game-limiting and highly likely to break the game savegame 8MB limit issue just can't allow me to defend this game or the developer anymore (if you aren't aware if your savegame - either through crafting or collecting items or just playing the game - goes over 8MB it becomes corrupted and unusable and CDPR said ""stop loading games""). So the official solution to a broken game - on PC, which is now the prime platform for the game - is don't play it the way you want to, stop wanting to get good value for your money...unacceptable.[/strike] This issue was supposedly fixed with 1.06, however the company's initial attitude and response was still indefensible. 

At the end of the day all that was promised (and still is in the game description as of this writing) was just marketing strategy and delivered very poorly or not at all. I don't think CDPR will be able to salvage half of what was promised from this jumbled mess of a release.

Of course I asked for a refund 5 days after purchasing it...but as is the standard with the gaming industry Steam act as gatekeepers to the Ponzi scheme the gaming industry has become. Next time you read about how bad piracy is think about what these bozos have been doing with your hard earned money. As for me this is the last AAA game I have bought for a long time.

"I want to start that like many people I was really pumped for this game. After spending a considerable amount of time with it and getting two of the endings I feel comfortable writing this review.

I want to start out by saying, even on PC, I do not really believe this game was finished. Bugs aside I feel like it was changed a lot the direction they were going with it and parts that were supposed to be the game we were promised (Like the entire into montage with Jackie, I really feel like that was parts of the game that we were to play to build up a bigger connection with him) were scrubbed for more of the Johnny story. Not that it really is not bad, just it is nothing new. There is a lot of cool situations, but nothing is really fleshed out, the endings seem rushed, and it really shows they put a lot of time into other parts of the game once they saw that Keanu would be a big selling point. 

Not to say I did not enjoy my time in it. It was a fun game, I felt good playing it. Even with other negative aspects of the combat becoming repetitive, driving being abysmal, and random bugs making some mission goals even unachievable. They have a lot of work to go to make the game “finished” or “complete” and I am more than willing to give it another go when it is to that point. There are just too many things left unfinished, half used ideas and nothing new brought to the table for me to really say it is the 10/10 game they made it seem to be. 

Now I will say these people are deserving of you buying it and playing it. Them getting the money to work on it and fix it all up. It is not the developers or content creators’ fault that it is the way it is right now. The game was rushed from the top down. I do believe in time it will (or at least has the capability to be) the game we were all promised. At this point though, I would have to give it a 6/10.

A bunch of broken promises,False
"No ai for the NPCs driving, no cops chasing you (they just magically spawn behind you). graphically it's beautiful if your system can run it, but gameplaywise it's stuck in 1996.

Maybe if they ever update this to include half the things they promised to include, it would be a recommendation, but as it stands, this game has made me regret pre-ordering.",False
"There's a lot of negative press surrounding this game right now, but I think it's mostly unwarranted. There's a lot of butthurt people on two sides: One group hates the game for the glitches and lack of depth and the unkept promises, the other group will defend it at any cost and if you raise any concern you're labeled a troll just riding on the hate bandwagon.

I was going into this game with zero expectations and I didn't keep up with the press releases. I recently played Witcher 3 and I thought it was pretty unique, beautiful, and story/lore-rich. I figured if the same company was going to make this game, it's got to be good.

There are bugs and glitches, and the game has crashed on me a few times, but overall it runs pretty well. The main complaints I have are:
1. AI. This gets talked about a lot and it's true, the AI is pretty weak. There are times when an enemy stops fighting you and just stares at you if he's stuck on an object, and combat is somewhat predictable. The automobile AI is even worse.
2. Lack of Meaningful Choices. I haven't come across a conversation yet where there was a meaningful decision made. Most of the time, there's only one dialogue option that can progress the story, and the other options are just there if you want more information about something. The times when there are multiple ways to progress the story, the decisions simply don't matter. In rare cases, the NPC will say the exact same response no matter which dialogue option you choose.
3. The bugs. These annoy me when they crash my game or interfere with quest progression. Luckily those are few and far between (in my experience). The much more common bugs are things randomly flying away, or stepping on a can and being thrown somewhere. Those bugs don't bother me as much; I remember when Skyrim was young.

The main things I love about this game are:
1. The RPG Elements. Despite what some are saying, I think the RPG-ness is spot-on. There's randomized loot, leveling, skill development, collecting, crafting. The character customization is pretty strong, and it's easy to make distinctly unique characters. There's an extensive list of skills, cyberware, mods. I knew I loved it when I got the leg enhancement that lets me double jump. The crafting and skill development has been improved from Witcher 3, which was already pretty good.
2. The Combat. Despite the AI, combat is fun. There are multiple ways to kill enemies, from stealth to hacking to brute strength. Melee combat is pretty fluid (if not a bit OP), and ranged combat feels Borderlands-esque which works fine for me. 
3. The Ambiance. The game is beautiful, the voice acting is great, the lore is rich. It really does feel like a different world, yet familiar.

CDPR is getting a decent amount of hate right now but I think it's a solid game. They took a LOT on their plate when they decided to make this game, and I feel like they might have spread themselves a bit too thin in trying to develop everything at once. This game has the potential to be a masterpiece and I believe CDPR can make it happen. In the meantime, I don't regret my purchase. It's been a lot of fun.",True
"The selling point of 2077 was freedom and the environment of its word and atmosphere, from what I could understand in the videos and hype surrendered the game. 

While there is some freedom, there is not a lot you can do that is your choice that can affect the gameplay. Player modification is just which mod is better without a lot of variety to choose, and most of them are not something new that we have not seen, something like double jump and power jump, take less damage and even have an arm that can shoot a rocket is not something that can make the players feel special or eye-catching in its current combat system.

The weapon modding system is another ""joke"" in this game, there are only two types of items that can affect the visual of your weapon, sight, and suppressor. If you going to force the player to look at their weapons(the game being FPS only), at least put more effort into allowing the player to change the visual of their weapon, or go with the Borderlands route and make lots of weapons that the player can choose.

The point of having an open world is to let the player explore the world, but I can't explore anything when my PC is calling for help every time I drove. However, that could have been my fault, but I failed to understand why they would put a ""main story"" system into the game. If you want the player to explore your world, the player should't go to a place because the game told them to, the player should explore the world because they wanted to, and do missions that they want not should.

The skill tree is another mess, there are way too many trees that pretty much just stats increase, and the individual  ""tree level"" in a way forces the player to play a certain style to take on combat, which is not something you want to do in a game that supposes to be having a lot of freedom.



In my opinion, they should remove the rarity system in items, or add co-op. This is not an MMORPG, and it is single-player only, one of the upsides of having a rarity in other games is a sense of pride, but that simply does not apply to this game for being a single-player only. And there is no point in ""grinding' in this game because that conflicts with the game being freedom and exploring.

The weapon system could use an overhaul, preferably putting more effort into allowing the player to change their weapon visually and statistically. Examples being extended mags, changing caliber, changing sock, and changing the barrel length. If you have a weapon system that can be even close to the weapon modding system in Escape From Tarkov, you know you did something right. Another solution that is simpler is to allow the player to play in the third person, where the player does not care about the visual and only its statistics.

There really shouldn't be a story progression in an exploring game or main quest. The tasks should affect the player in resource and progression, but most importantly, the quest should affect the world around the player more than the player itself, for one of the selling points (I believe)of this game is having a unique environment(cyberpunk version of 2077).

For the skill tree, if you are not going to make ""unique""  or ""special"" mechanics that can affect the game-loop or combat, do not put them into a ""tree"" as it does not need to represent the player progression, because you already have a player level for that. If the point of the skill system was to allow the player to build a unique character, why limit the player on what can they build in a specific time or progression in the game? reduce the branches in the skill tree or just get rid of the tree itself and remove the limit of how many points player can put into it, if your skills are that simple, I am pretty sure players will not be confused about the difference between ""increase health by 10%"" or ""increase pistol damage by 10%"" and needed them to be categorized that specifically, and do not think we do not understand the meaning of ""+10% health"", the descriptions really do not need to be that long.

There are many things I can rant about this game, but I think those are the main features that ruined the expectation of the players, the expectation of freedom, and what you can do in the game. Do not get me wrong, this is still a good game, just not a great game, or a game that broke the limit of what videogame can do, like Half-life, or GTA. In another word, is not ""eye-opening"".

In my opinion, the game failed to understand what it wanted to be or what is special about it, it went down a road that makes it too generic. Either there was no clear vision for this game, or they got too dreamy about what this game should be and unable to perfect any of its aspects. I am not giving this game a bad review because it is a bad game, I am giving a bad review simply because of ""false advertisement""

"I had a ton of fun with this game but it is a buggy mess. While I enjoyed my time, I don't think most people should have to tolerate the broken mess. 3 different times I had game-breaking bugs but luckily was able to reload a previous save and it worked. At this point I have 45 hrs into the game and beat it with plenty of side missions that I didn't get around to.

"What a mess... Where do I even begin... Lets start with pros. Visually game looks really good. City looks really impressive and alive at first glance. Character designs look fresh and colorful. Voice acting is superb, radio stations have some bangers and soundtrack overall is pretty good. Whole lore is interesting aswell. But thats where pros end. Im not gonna tell how many bugs and glitches Ive found because its countess, and it would be a low hanging fruit to pick. Lets start with rpg elements. There are very little of those. From the get go you start with choosing what life path you will go for. And pretty much only first intro missions will be impacted by that. Maybe the end aswell, but Im not going to torture myself anymore to find that out. There will be some dialog options of your life path, but it doesnt seem that it makes any difference on how mission will be played out. Skills and attributes are pretty boring outside a few hacking ones that can be fun. Lets talk about loot you collect. This game is more of a looter shooter than anything else. Loot is everywhere. And most of it is useless and pain in the ass to even sell it in those drop boxes or whatever they are called. I dont know who was the genius to make gear that has stats. If you want to have good stats on your character, you most likely gonna look like a clown most of the time. I thought this is going to be an rpg experience... Why do I have to look like a rejected stripper clown with a bulletproof west and a fedora to have good stats? Combat feels alright I guess... I didint expect some top tier fps shooter or anything. But melee combat is just bare bones at best... Lets talk about A.I... Im not sure what happened there, but A.I. is hands down the most stupid one Ive ever seen on any video game. First you step into the city, youll be impressed in how many different kind of people are out there and they look like they have theyr own jobs and dutiers to do. But once you try to fallow them around to see what they gonna do, its like you break the matrix. If you go aggressive towards them, theyre just going to crouch down and do nothing. Car A.I. is as dubb as normal civilians. If youll leave your car in the middle of the street, they will just stop infront of it and do nothing. Cause they dont know how to go around you. Can you have fun just by killing everyone and go on a police chase? No. Cause police cant even drive cars. And as a matter of fact, once you drive off like a block or two, they will forget you ever did anything bad. Whole city has alot of nudity and ads with sexual references, but only two prostitutes if you wanna have fun like that. For the most part you will be driving around the city. And driving isnt good either. Its not horrible, but still could be better. Player freedom in this game is very very limited. I really really doubt that you could finish this game without killing anyone. There goes your role play. I could go on and on with all the negative stuff this game has. And no matter how many patches and fixes theres gonna be, the game is just broken beyond repair in my opinion. 5/10 at best.",False
Beautifully created world. Beat it in 37 hours doing around 90% of the side quests. Looking forward to future DLC. Game was a bit easy in my opinion and would of loved some more options to craft/upgrade certain special gear ala Witcher 3 with armor and weapons.,True
"First off, the game is good, but not great. 
This is not in the same class as the witcher 2/3. Then i do suggest you play it? sure, if you know what to expect.
Do play all the side missions.. really..  (not the dumb racing/buying cars or fighting missions)... but i'd strongly suggest doing the other side ones. They are the meat of the game. Oddly the cop missions, which are pretty boring, you might want to do a bunch of those too. They have  loot/patterns you might want.

What this is not. Again, not future witcher, not dues ex, not GTA.
sneaking sucks, driving SUPER SUCKS, loot system is boring, talnet tree doesn't change much, combat is ez.

Night City, it self, is pretty cool. Hopefully you have a beefy systems that can play it with Ray Tracing. DLSS is a must for any system.

Maybe wait a bit for the bugs to get fix, but, for me, it wasn't that bad.
oh, do quick save A LOT, that helps with bugs, but the game can put in you into combat really fast when you didn't want to be.. reloading is a better option that screwing up a mission. Yes, you can lose out on content by doing the ""wrong"" things. 

Don't expect much and you'll enjoy yourself. :D  Also change it up.  Having fun with smart weaspons? try punchy punchy or hacking? In the end you'll have enough points to dump it into a lot of areas.
Note, i kinda wouldn't put to many points into gun related stuff.  Shooting will kill people, it doesn't need extra crit or damage. 
Also the best weapons comes from crafting. I ended up first maxing tech and crafting and then when for quickhacking.

here is some video or a random mission i was doing:

"The game could definitely use a little work but I still feel like I've gotten my moneys worth. The setting is phenomenal, the combat is fun and simple, the characters are fantastic, and the story is nice change of pace from usual FPS game plotlines. 

Cyberpunk does have some performance issues and bugs from time to time but I haven't experience anything too extreme or game breaking so far and I am playing on a fairly low quality PC.

Don't jump on the hate train for this game, give it a fair shot and you might fall in love with it like I have.",True
"Before I start the review I'd like to clarify a few things:
- My system specs: Intel i7-8700 / RTX 2070 8GB / 16GB RAM
- This review is only for the PC (Steam) version of the game.
- I bought and played this game on Launch Day and this review is based solely on my experiences so far.

After playing over 100+ hours, completing my 1st playthrough of the Main Story and starting my 2nd playthrough, I feel I am now ready to provide my honest review for this game.

I'll start by saying Yes, at launch, the game is definitely buggy, but other than Animation / Texture bugs and a few random CTDs, I haven't encountered anything major and did not lose any major progress. For me, the game ran almost perfectly. I guess I'm one of the lucky ones.

The Graphics for the game is fantastic and mindblowing, and based on some Youtubers comparison of the E3 Reveal Demo and Retail, the retail version actually looked much better, so kudos to that. Again, like CDPR's earlier game Witcher 3, Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that you would buy to show off your new PC or Graphics Card.

The Music soundtrack is another Masterpiece. From the dark instrumental themes to the cool electro punk / metal tunes on the in-game Radio, to the rediculous crazy in-game Advertisements, all of them do a really good job in immersing you into the world. Gun sounds, and Sound Effects in general are equally good.

The whole game is an open-world not unlike the GTA series where you can roam about doing whatever you want, jack whatever vehicles you want and tackle whatever side quests you want with a main story at the background. The only difference is, the setting which is of course a near-future Cyberpunk world. 

This game is how I felt Deus Ex Human Revolution should have been. I liked that CDPR took the time to consider how a Cyberpunk City would look like not only at Night, but also Daytime. I especially love the Rural Badlands outside of Night City that are filled with Junk and Garbage bags that you can actually explore. The world is so beautifully crafted with attention to detail, its insane!

One very important thing I need to mention is that almost the entire game is played in 1st Person View and while I initially did not approve of this direction, I wasn't actually bothered by it at all when I actually played the game. In fact some scenes in the game actually worked better for 1st Person View. Still, I would not mind if a 3rd Person View mode is included.

On top of all this, it is a full fledged RPG with a proper character creation, leveling systems and perk trees, and your dialogue choices actually do matter. Despite it being an RPG, combat feels smooth and all damage calculations are done in the background. If you want to be Guns Blazing, using only Violence to resolve situations, you can do it. If you want a No Kills No Guns using only Stealth and Hacking, the game allows you to do that too. I'm not kidding. On my 2nd playthrough, I have not shot a single bullet nor thrown a single punch, and the game is still perfectly playable. This is how flexible the game system is.

The main story in my opinion is well-crafted and well worth your time. It has a certain urgency to it, but there are no time limits in completing it. The story isn't all punk and violence, and as a Gamespot Reviewer mentioned it has some beautiful scenarios in its quieter moments. Every voice-actors does a good job and its really fun to play the game alongside Keanu Reeve's character Johnny Silverhand who acts like a 2nd Protagonist. While the player is certainly important, personally I feel the main story is more a story about Johnny, and your character is just the player's eyes into this world. And yes, you can still continue to play the game after the Main Story has concluded.

I also liked that the optional Romance Sub-Quests were surprisingly beefy with their own lore and some of them actually takes you to very different areas in the game and out of the Night City urban environment. Not only that, some of them actually do have an impact on the Main Story.

Now on the the sections that I did not like:
As good as the game is, there were parts where I felt CDPR had cut or shortened the content. The most jarring one is a ""6 months timeskip"" cutscene right at the beginning of the Prologue. I was really disappointed we were not given the chance to play this out as this would've made some scenes later in the game that much more impactful and emotional.

Another gripe I had was that Jackie was your starting companion for all lifepaths. I mean he was fine for probably Nomad and Street Kid, but he looked totally out of place in a Corpo Life Path. I wish they at least had a different starting companion for each of the Life Paths.

The AI for NPCs needs alot of work. Sometimes they are brain-dead, sometimes they cheat. (Especially when you're sneaking around them)

There are no vehicle customizations or even an option to change your appearance after character creation which felt very strange considering how much the ingame universe puts a heavy emphasis on being able to modify your body to whatever you desire.
Jacking vehicles while fun, aren't of any use when there is no garage to keep them

There are many other such examples that seem common place in other Open-World games, that are strangely absent in this game. Hopefully a DLC or a QOL Patch will bring these in later.

Overall Rating: 8 / 10

(Review Score Addendum Update:
Originally I gave 9 / 10 for this game. After seriously thinking about it, it really doesn't deserve a 9 from me. Not at its current state anyway. Still, I really did enjoy the time I spent with the game.)

Despite it's buggy launch, this is a very ambitious game and is very well made. Had it not had such a bad launch, it would have been the Gold Standard by which Future Open-World Cyberpunk games would be compared to.

If you enjoyed Deus Ex Human Revolution, you will enjoy this game. especially if you enjoy Sci-Fi or the Cyberpunk genre. (Note: Your experience may be very different from mine depending on the specs of your computer.) 

If not, I would recommend to wait a couple of months until it is better patched before you delve in. Either way, do not miss this game.",True
"The game is buggy, what do you expect? A completely flawless game? (we all know those exist).  It's a newly released game with a massive open world that has a lot of detail - and potential. In it's current state, it's buggy. And do I feel they kept all their promises? No. But, this game is honestly a lot of fun: the major problem is that people had expectations that were just too high and as such, they were heavily disappointed. And honestly, I've not actually seen as many bugs as I'd expected (not saying there isn't a lot, it's just I've only seen a couple with what I've played so far). Not only that but people complained and complained, whined and cried because CDPR kept delaying it: so they released it. And now people are complaining because it's not finished... boo fricken hoo.  And another thing i heard is that enemies are bullet sponges: if they take half your health in one shot, and you're having to load their head with all your lead, than you ain't a high enough level to fight them so come back later.  Am I saying this game is without it's flaws? Certainly not, it is no where near perfect, but has there even been a perfect game?  So yes, it is a good game. There's so much to do and explore, so many corners to peak at, so many roads to drive on, so many side quests to complete, and so many endings to see. I've heard people talk about its performance... of course you wont be able to play the game on high-ultra with raytracing on a f&*%^&* rtx 280 Sherlock. With that being said, my pc isnt great, but it runs well on mostly medium with 1-2 things on high (nvidia 1060 with fx-8350 processor). The world is a very interesting one, crafted with a lot of detail: I recommend this game, not for the state it's in right now, but for what it will turn to be in the future. Maybe give it a month or two to see how things are going with patches and overall development. If you wanna try it now, go for it!",True
Despite many problmes... still a great game with an incredible story,True

"It pains me to say it, but I cannot recommend the game at this time.  The Witcher 3 was one of my favorite games of all time, and the information about CP2077 led me to believe that the narrative would be on par with The Witcher series, but with even more depth.  Decisions had consequences, the world was alive around you, the story and characters were a complex web just waiting to be picked apart...

That is not what we got.  The backstory of your character is glossed over so quickly that the choice makes almost no difference other than providing some special dialogue options on occasion.  Characters that you're supposed to have connections with are passed over so quickly that you just don't really care what happens to them.  The AI of the Night City citizens is terrible and negatively affects immersion.  I spent a few hours in GTA V just to gauge the contrast, and the sense of immersion there was higher for me despite the massive gulf in graphical fidelity.  The way that NPCs react to events in the world feels so much more convincing in GTA than CP... things like running away or fighting back, taking cover, not randomly disappearing if you look away and look back...  GTA V is 7 years old now and easily makes CP2077 look bad in comparison.

I've run into my fair share of bugs.  Most are funny, few are game breaking.  For something so large and complex, I'm more than happy waiting for CDPR to fix the bugs, but the core issues are another matter.  I feel like so much of the information shared throughout development ended up being false.  We got a technical marvel of a game that wants to be like Witcher or GTA, but feels less fun and more superficial than either.

On the bright side, the graphics are phenomenal.  I'm fortunate enough to have a machine that can play the game with most of the bells and whistles turned on, and it is nothing short of breathtaking.  I found myself enjoying looking at the character models and scenery more than actually playing the game.  Some characters look absolutely real, and I found myself constantly in awe at the lighting and detail of the world.

I have faith in CDPR.  I know this game has been a labor of love for all the developers, game designers, artists, and others.  I'm sure the bugs will get fixed and performance improved, and I very much hope that time can be taken to polish the narrative and other systems in way that will deliver on the massive promise that I know the game has.",False

"I haven't finished it yet, so I can't comment on how I feel about the entire game. But from where I'm at now, I can say this. 
This game is definitely worth it, there is more than enough to do and keep you occupied for hours. Sometimes you'll start doing a side quest and next thing you know it's hours later and you're just going from side quest to side quest without even bothering with the main story. Which I definitely don't mind at all! 
The gunplay feels really good in my opinion, especially when it comes down to the close quarters stuff with blades and stuff. (I personally end up pulling out my mantis blades and just ending everyone!)
the driving can be wonky sometimes, but overall it's enjoyable!
As of where I'm at with the story right now, it's definitely one of the most well written and executed single player experiences I've played in a long time.",True
"I'd be lying if I said the game wasn't interesting, or decently fun when everything is working well and they have you in a good, immersive mission. The visuals are great, the city itself is great, the music is amazing. 

But this literally isn't the game they advertised. This game is more GTA or Far Cry than an RPG. The game is absolutely paper thin in every last single mechanic it tries to implement.  God awful optimization and half hilarious half immersion breaking bugs run rampant. 

Unless you own a 30 series card or a 2080TI, hold off until patches if you can't stomach sub 60. If you're looking for a deep, customization filled role playing game in a cyberpunk setting, hold off.

Same problem reported by a friend who's got an RTX 2080 and i7-6700k. Also, the gunplay AI is problematic, as they seem to not seek cover and just stand out in the open (playing in hard difficulty). What makes gun combat hard is them just having a gazillion HP. Car mechanics are meh at best, but since this is an RPG game I can mostly ignore that. The dodgy optimization is what might turn many people with lower specs off. As of writing this, I am 3 hours into the game and I'm enjoying the story so far. The character customization is pretty nice. And the graphics are simply stunning. Just hoping they will fix the optimization ASAP.

"This review is not about bugs or how and what or well it runs. This is review is about content, or lack there of in my opinion.

Night City is a beautifully constructed box that on the surface looks like a truly living, breathing and evolving world, to say that once you get underneath that initial glamorous veneer it's not would be an understatement. Once under the flashy skin of NC everything feels robotic and bland, immersion goes right out the window as citizens proceed to do nothing but walk around and simply exist for the sake of making your screenshots look populated.

The main story is well written but badly executed, V has in actuality has practically no choice in anything save a few choices near the end not to mention way too many situations where you are literally forced onto a railroad where you sit and talk for almost 10 minutes straight with little to no skip options.

Side Content is abysmal, aside from a few side gigs here and there nearly all of them amount to ""Go Here, Kill People, Get Money.""

Equipment, skills and kills are fucking great. The one thing I can't complain about in this game is the skill trees and the weapons, they all come life beautifully and you can make some truly unique character builds, considering 95% of the game outside of the long dialogue bits in the mainstory pretty much only contains you just killing people over and over again they atleast did a very good job of making it fun to do so.

Character development - When I hear the words character development I think one of two things, as a person who's personality and decisions I shape over time or just the classic stats and attribute growth of an RPG individual, games got the latter covered, the former however is a total shitshow, no mater what background you choose, no matter what phony choice CDPR puts in front of you in dialogue V will always be the same tough talking mercenary with a heart of gold. This is personally the GREATEST letdown of this game to me. After playing the Witcher Series and albeit enjoying playing as Geralt I was absolutely stoked to be allowed to play my own character my own way, the one thing the Witcher series was lacking for me. Nothing you do will change V, not even the vaunted life paths choices which do nothing but offer you the occasional different, albeit still not changing anything, dialogue option.

I'll end by saying I wasn't someone who jumped on the hype train as after 20+ years of video gaming has taught me better than that but even still I am disappointed with Cyberpunk 2077. It's too late to gut the whole game and make V's choices matter more but it's not too late to work their asses off by fixing what's there and injecting as much content as possible post game, whether through free patches or DLC.

✅Altering Reality
🔲Excellent
🔲It's OK
🔲Bad
🔲Gonna ruin your eyes
The graphics quality in this game is pretty damn impressive. The lighting, the buildings, streets, and especially the automobiles are very detailed. Can see every stitching inside the interior of a car, or the soft glow from the speedometer display reflecting on the steering wheel at night. Sure there are some places where stuff isn't very detailed, but most of the time it's very impressive indeed. (Ok to enjoy the incredible graphics quality and details you'll have to use atleast high settings or better, otherwise the graphics will be just so-so)

[b]Gameplay[/b]

🔲Can't stop playing
✅Nice
🔲Average
🔲Bad
🔲Just awful
So this is an FPS action shooter with RPG elements on it. Combat with guns is quite fun and there is additional hacking skills to help with combat/stealth. However the RPG elements shows up when landing multiple headshots on enemies doesn't immediately kill them (unless when I'm using a powerful sniper rifle), and I think that doesn't really make much sense, sure enemies with strong armor (helmet or whatever) may resist 1-2 headshots, but still being alive after over 5 headshots is kinda unreal. Driving mechanics is very arcade and not really that good, it's not terrible, but still I'd say GTA 5 does this better. Main story mission length isn't actually that long, consisting of 3 main Acts. If you're ought to finish only the main story mission you might be able to complete it in like 30 hours, maybe less.

[b]SFX & Music[/b]

🔲Could win the Grammy's
✅Soothes my ears
🔲Average

🔲Sounds like 2 cats f*cking at 2 am
The game has got some nice and decent background music and sound effects. Some missions utilizes the music nicely to spice up the story. Ambient noise is also well done like standing in the middle of a crowded market will give you some noise and conversations overlapping each other. Cars and bikes got an alright sound, one that caught my attention is the Caliburn which sounds very much like a Lexus LFA.

[b]Romance & Sex Scenes[/b]

✅OH YES

Oh yes this game really excels in the hot lewd scenes. Despite them not really showing the real action, the background music and voice-overs really made them feel real. And yes the characters' bodies are so well detailed I can see every pore on their skin. Only 4 main long term romance options are available in this game, 2 options each for female V and male V. And along the way some side missions actually do get you laid (only very few).

[b]Bugs and Glitches[/b]

🔲Free from bugs
🔲Very few bugs

Don't even get me started on this one, since there are tons of bugs and glitches in this game. From basic stuff glitching and colliding with something else, to very annoying glitches that prevented me from saving the game and progressing at all, cyberpunk, no cyberbug 2077 provides all your glitching needs. Hoping CDPR to do a great job in fixing and patching the game in the future.

I can only hope this game pulls a No Man's Sky one day.",False
"An open world game with a lot to look at but little to do!


The story missions introduce the world which then becomes boring and empty once you leave the story missions. There isn't much to do in the game other than go kill people for the fixers (quest givers) and anytime the story introduces a new mechanic or sub-area, it has no use of is unusable in the free play and roaming aspect of the game.

The AI in this game is honestly terrible. The NPCs on the streets and in cars offer nothing to the game. You can ram your car full speed at a bunch of cars on the road and they all carry on like nothing happened. The AI for drivers also seems to make it impossible for them to drive if you stop in front of them either in person or leave your car there. They will literally just beep their horn and not move, no matter how much time passes.

The stealth seems quite strong with the fact you can one shot anyone who isn't massively overleveled in comparison but then you switch to guns and they are a bullet sponge. The enemies also seem to be able to hack you and see you through walls while you need a clear line of site.

The story, lore and characters all seem great from what I have played so far but I have heard they make up a tiny portion of the game (around 20 hours) and when I wasn't doing the story, the game feels empty, lifeless and feels like it is missing a bunch of features that you would expect after 8 years of development or even for a basic open world rpg game. 

There is no customisation whatsoever, you can't customise your vehicles, your character (other than clothes, which you are almost forced to wear the ones with the most armour), your apartment or even your hair! (Even the Witcher 3 had that).

It feels like when you aren't doing the story, you are just in the world to kill people and move on to the next kill. The fact that brain dance (in game VR recreations) has no place in the game other than in select story missions feels like a massive missed opportunity. The fact you have all the clubs and bars in the game and can't even buy a drink and sit and drink it (goes into inventory for later and it's like cans of coke) seems weird. You have so much pointless loot it's unreal with the select few weapons actually being different (feels like there is a total of 5 weapons of each type).

There just feels like the game could have has so much more life in it, so much more depth to the world and features that would have made it a truly amazing open world to explore and enjoy but after 8 years, it's just ""go here, kill them, get paid, repeat"".

Main points:
- the world feels like a backdrop for main missions
- quickly becomes empty and lifeless when not doing those missions
- terrible AI, especially for driving and especially after what they promised
- travel, kill, reward, repeat missions.
- no customisation after the initial character creator
- story, lore and characters seem great
- combat is unbalanced and mediocre at best
- an open world game with a lot to look at but very little to do
- missing basic features present in open world games for decades now 
- didn't make the most of any of the unique feeling aspects of the game
- music is banging though",False

"[h1]Version 1.06[/h1]
I cannot recommend this game in this state. Too many bugs and glitches. Some glitches ruined the immersion in story missions for me. The police spawning instantly behind you after a crime is a joke. Police pursuit system is almost non-existent.

The menu screen and all it's sub-systems (inventory, crafting, character build trees etc.) feel like a place holder beta build version. Story and side missions for the most part are dull. The dialogue is mostly boring drivel and uninspired. There were some good moments in the main story but not many.

Nothing fun to do in the often times beautiful Night City. Boring. Soulless City. Combat was nothing special. Quickhacking was like a visually dull magic system. Breach Protocol wasn't fun to use and pulled you out of the action during combat.

Music was pretty good.

When the game is truly finished and all the DLC drops I'll give it another chance.

"After some consideration, watching how people play it on Ultra settings and various videos, I decided to refund this game. While my specs are lacking there is something more rather my GPU limitations. Game is poorly optimised, almost broken on consoles and filled with bugs. But most importantly, it feels like an expensive movie set for uninspired ""Polish shooter"". It's not an RPG, it's not a sandbox, it's a linear shooter in empty open-world decorations. It's a mess. And overhyped junk.


--------------------------
Original review:

I understand that my specs aren't suitable for high settings. But FPS and frame time choppy even on low-med settings in 1080p. I'm getting 25-38 FPS depending on a scene. Hell, I lowered my settings even more with GeForce Experience suggestions, which turned the game into a potato. Yet still, frame times are subpar at best and that only gave me like 5 more frames per second in a crowded street.

I see that people with High-End $700+ GPU's getting somewhat decent performance but not everyone can afford (and honestly, buy one in 2020). And when people compare it to Crysis 1 from 2007 I'd like to remind that Crysis looked fine on medium, not like a potato mush. To make matters worse, users on PS4/xOne are in an even worse situation. Cyberpunk 2077 could definitely spend at least 6 more months in development, the game simply not done.",False
"Game looks really impressive during the linear story missions, especially with HDR and raytracing on. But it while it performs well enough for a next-gen looking game during the story missions it completely comes apart during the open world segments, poor performance, dropping frames like mom's spaghetti without rhyme or reason.
I'm gonna request a refund and will go back to this game once the performance patches start fixing up the messy open world code. If I just kept this game without refunding, twiddling my thumbs until they feel like cleaning up performance I'd feel like rewarding the developers for putting out a poorly optimized product like this is some kind of early access indie developer.
So at this point I'd recommend anyone with specs below a RTX 3080 who wants to play this game at it's best to wait for the devs to stabilize their product.",False

"CDPR spent all this money for the game on advertising and at somepoint along the way, failed to make the game they advertised.  This is a short, shallow FPS with dialogue choices that don't actually do anything.  Nothing makes any sense because the world is filled with all these things we have no idea what they are.  I don't know what a fixer is, I don't know what a runner is, they have all these setting exclusive terms, but never tell you what any of them mean.  

V sounds horrible at least in the male character, he is dry and boring.  Doesn't matter if hes badly injured or drunk, he sounds like a guy that got paid to walk into a studio, say his lines as fast as possible and leave. 

The game play is exceptionally generic, i feel like i'm playing every FPS to release over the last 12 years.  All guns feel the same, no weight to any of them, fights are short bursts of ""cover, shoot all your ammo into sponge man, cover to reload"" repeat until all the bad guys are dead. Remember when Borderlands 2 came out and it had a very cool take on FPS combat with a run and gun method?  Yeah man, so do I. 

Melee combat is even worse, its like skyrims melee, you just stand there swinging until they die.  No depth beyond *click click click*  Not even  sure why its in the game to be honest, for all the QOL featurers that don't exist in this game for whatever reasons they decided no one would want, they left in this.  I'd rather have a way to remake my character then an outdated melee system.


But Bleeding Neon, whats the worst part of this game though? You ask, entranced by my garbage review, well dear reader ill tell you.  Its the backstories.  These were a crux of the marketing, 3 totally unique, developed settings to give you a reason to become invested in your character, in the vain of the tabletop RPG this game is based off of.  Instead we were given 30 minute on rail setups, they're 3 different ways you fall into the main story.  They mean *nothing* outside of the occasional dialouge choice, that as i mentioned don't actually amount to anything.  The backstories are frankly insulting, they should not exist in this form, either make them decent or don't have them, its without a doubt the most severe case of ""Illusion of choice"" cyberpunk 2077 commits.  Wanna play a game with cool backstories? play dragon age origins, a real RPG.

I played the Witcher 2 release day back on the 360.  CDPR got me into the Witcher, I read all the books and comics, I loved this company just like everyone else did.  We were all fooled by once good games, at this point I am convinced The Witcher 3 was a scam, for this company to make absolute bank on their next title for 1/4th the work.  The long con as they call it, they played us like a damn fiddle.

On the other hand, the game is everything I expected to be and more.

Although the soundtrack is great, and moments in the story or side quests are entertaining and thought-provoking, the bugs and skipped content really leave a sour taste in the mouth.

I have a half decent system (i7-10700K & RTX 2080 super) and could just about manage a smooth 60fps with high settings and rtx on medium. Currently playing Shadow of the Tomb Raider with max setting and rtx and the water effects put Cyberpunk to shame..

I've deliberately left a few achievements so I can 100% this when they do all the patches and free dlc (aka missed content). It's a shame really as Witcher 3 is one of my favourite games of all time.

I've seen a lot talking about lack of choice but thats very untrue as every mission ive come across as had at least 3 ways to complete them and a few others i am sure i missed, what many forget is that the game does not have to hold your hand and use pop ups to rail road you.

The only expectations I had going in were that it would be a well made and interesting CD Projekt Red title, having very much enjoyed The Witcher 3. The problems with the game are much more fundamental than the (very often) buggy scripted events and overall jankiness. Your decisions are inconsequential, characters pop in and out of the story without any time to ever get to know or care about them, and you really have no agency to define your own character as they have already written V and shoehorned you in. This is a game you could skip and you wouldn't be missing out on much more than something of the likes of Fallout 4, but it's arguably worse. Maybe it's my fault for expecting there to actually be role-playing elements in this RPG but all there seems to be is the RPG systems (looting, perks, levels, crafting). The best thing it has going for it is the visual style, not necessarily impressive graphics, but certainly it looks cool and the art team did a great job. It seems like there was a lot of wasted potential to tell a really interesting and engaging story in this world, but it falls flat very quickly. Side content is lacking even more than the main story, they have done a poor job at disguising very basic rescue and kill quests with the bare minimum in terms of writing, and the rest of the side stuff is just straight up ""kill x amount of enemies in this area"".

The combat is clunky, with revolvers that can deal twenty thousand crit damage on feet and snipers dealing 400 on headshot. It's there, but not fleshed out and doesn't have half the cool shit the trailers did.

The brakes are made of plastic candy wrappers and navigating through the city with that minimap is better off being a torture experiment. also NO FUCKING FLYABLE VEHICLES?

Game runs piss fucking poor in both mid and high end computers I've tried it on, the graphics are astonishing but not enough to have me sacrifice my frames for it.
Speaking of frames, the game completely unplayable at any fps below 45, the aiming becomes stuttery and the game loop devolves into punishing the player for letting their feet be seen for more than 3 seconds.

"At its current state, the game is teeming with bugs and missing tons of features previously promised by CDPR. Many aspects of the game--AI, shooting, driving, character customization, progression system, weapon variety, balancing, just to name a few--are subpar at best and downright atrocious at worst. The main storyline is decent, but not quite captivating enough for me to overlook the game's plethora of issues and keep on playing. Many side quests are also very well written and introduce the player to a variety of interesting and memorable characters, but once again, they are simply not enough to keep me engaged in this largely empty and lifeless world.

This is the absolute pinnacle of the open world RPG as a concept - you can tackle situations in so many different ways depending on your stats, and this is honestly the first game I've felt so passionate about since Fallout New Vegas.

"The game could have been a decades' milestone á la Half-Life or Skyrim. I hope it will grow in this direction. But the overall quality of the game and the marketing lies are above a tolerable limit. Trust and business liability is lost and responsible is the executive mangement of CDPR. Why is that? Because honorable managers take the responsibilty but also marketing would likely be correct when developers would have had enough time, or respectively more developers would have worked on the project. 

There is so much more potential in the game. The story, the missions and challenges are awesome but all end too early. This is worth than all the glitches. Most of the glitches are funny, a few annoying and <1% game breaking - but just for the last save file. This discussion is overheated. The most annoying thing in the game is the fucking mini map. It is so very annoying during every ride through the city that you switch to fast travel for most of the time. It prevents you of enjoying the beautiful world design because you miss all turns over and over again or you are mislead on a straight road by jumping lane advises for no reason! This was no feedback during testing?! I cannot believe this was no issue. 
Another major flaw is the uniform stupid behaviour of AIs, in particular car drivers. Examples are more than bearable on youtube - One might ask from which CDPR manager's engram the NPC received their mind? Getting out of the car and squat next to its door is not the solution to everything.

When it comes to PC games, the celebrity integration, so the appearance of real life actors in games, never convinced me, so I expected something major cringe worthy of Mr Reeves in the game. But I was very wrong -  well done integration, good script/role, awesome acting.
 
Note: The visuals (besides the many glitches) are breathtaking and the sounds are also on a new level - just beautiful! Let me repeat: The overall design of the characters, weapons, cars and their interior, the bikes. graffities, the city's architecture, their interior - tapestry, carpets the furniture is all very very good and nicely done. 'Even the trash looks smelly. The illumination is awesome. The clothes - absolutely insane lovely stuff - would wear IRL. 

Strength of the game: Immersion - by not switching characters (like in GTA) and the consequent 1st person perspective (optional while driving) you easily become V - the protagonist.

What is missing: speed adjusted augmented direction and turn advice (no mini map for driving), car/bike tuning, other apartment and real estate acquisition, npc bike riders, horizontal and vertical cyber-enhanced movement on walls, more underground levels (some might call them dungeons), more story, more relationship options and what about elves, ogers and such, well the Animals are already in, but honestly what about a little magic too?",False
"[h1][b]TL;DR:[/b] One of the best gaming failures of 2020.[/h1]
Yes, we've waited for this game for 8 years. Yes, the expectations were really high. Did the game meet them? Absolutely not. Does this mean Cyberpunk is a [b]bad game[/b]? No, of course not.

I will not go deep into explaining what this game is: think [b]Witcher 3[/b] in the world of dystopian future, but with character customization, slightly more edgy dialogues and more genitalia that you would possibly like to see in a lifetime.

CDPR marketed [i]way[/i] too many features before they realized they won't be able to deliver even half of them. Yes, story is absolutely great and has 5 distinct endings (actually, even 9, but those are just slighter variations of those 5). Yes, Keanu Reeves delivers great voice acting (although, being a very questionable character) and female V voice actress is pretty great too.

But does the world feel alive? Alas, it doesn't. NPCs refuse to interact with you (no random quest encounters), cops spawn out of thin air behind you (no car chases, no bribes), all gangs shoot you on sight (no reputation system), your home apartment is the same shit hole for the whole game (no home upgrades/customization)... Lots and lots of stuff that was promised got removed from the game, in order to be able to ship it before Christmas.

To keep it short and sweet, devs did not deliver most of the stuff they were supposed to, but the game is still pretty great. No ground-breaking mechanics, but a vibrant world of the grim future and a very good story. Is it worth full $60 of the asking price? That's for you to decide.

"TL;DR: In its current state, this game is like a shadow of its potential, I advise you to wait before buying it. 

Today I finished the game, I had quite a lot of fun, there's no denying that. However it also left a sour taste in my mouth. I felt like this could have been so much better. It might have been a lot more satisfying if only CDPR spent more time developing it. 

The main thing I look for in games is how the story plays out. Cyberpunk 2077's story would be downright amazing had this been a game from the COD franchise or a movie. Yet for a CDPR game, apart from the ending and a few isolated cases, the story felt a bit linear. 

Don't get me wrong, it still yanks your attention, glues you to your seat and makes you want to play just one more hour just to see what's going to happen next as Keanu Reeves really breathes life into Johnny Silverhand and the game makes you really connect with most of the characters on an emotional level.  However I felt like I, as the player, didn't have much say in which way the story was going to go. I'm not talking about world changing impacts where everything goes upside down in a moment. I'm talking about seeing those minor implications, the subtle changes we cause with our choices throughout the story.

That being said, almost all of the side quests were original mini stories of their own and I really enjoyed what they offered. The only downside might be that there weren't many of them, however since most of them were quite creative and intriguing, we could say ""quality over quantity"" and make peace with that fact.

NPCs acting dumb and disappearing into oblivion, the police system, lack of activities in the city, crashes, performance issues, visual bugs and even game braking bugs...  The missing RPG elements like getting haircuts, changing our makeup or the inability to make fashion choices without worrying about our build... Limits of character creation like the body type sliders... These are the main things I believe, that are really hurting the game. The issues with the story I mentioned might be a personal thing for me, but these will be felt by everyone playing the game, they are going to break your immersion, take away the excitement and prevent you from fully enjoying the game. Without improving these elements, Night City feels like a glorified lobby where people drive around and enjoy the views while they search for a game, aka quests.

All in all, we were promised an open world ""RPG"" game ""with"" shooter elements that was going to ""immerse"" us in a futuristic world. It was promised that the Night City would have ""a life of its own"" and we would be a part of that as the player. At its current state I can't say these promises were fully kept and are there for you to experience.

What makes me hopeful is that most of the negativity surrounding the game stems from technical issues and a number of missing minor features which can be fixed given enough time. If CDPR  keeps working on the game and manages to implement the necessary improvements I'll update my review to ""Recommended"".",False
Overall the game is fun- some really bad glitches but it’s honestly kind of funny when they happen. I’m sure it’ll all get worked out over time with patches,True
"Literally unplayable, hot buggy mess within the first 10 minutes of the game.",False
"Finished game update: Its hard to give a game that I played through and have 50+ hours on a bad review, but if the intent of it is to tell people whether or not they should buy a game, the answer is still no. The problem with Cyberpunk is that the best parts could have just been made into a movie. What keeps you going is the great story telling, character development, voice acting, and really just a well done plot that even has branching endings that all do pretty well in their own right. The problem is -almost- everything else in the game has such bad technical problems and oversights that every time you might start to feel immersed in what is supposed to be this open worldy explorer game you are yanked right back to reality. 

In my playthrough I experienced a crash about every five hours on top of having to roll back saves 3 times losing about an hour of progress each time. Performance is abysmal and even on high end rigs you are sitting around 50-60 FPS out of combat. You are constantly surrounded by animations going haywire like lips not moving, NPCs T-posing and sliding across the ground, even cases where youll have two dialogues happening at once causing you to not be able to correctly pick spoken options. Even with all the bugs fixed, you would still have a game where the AI is about on par with GTA San Andreas. Theres just no life when you walk down the street, everyone is mindlessly power walking in a direction and the most interaction you'll get is them telling you to go fuck yourself. Shoot a gun up in the air? Everyone within a mile just squats down and covers their head for the next 10 minutes.

Even some of the core mechanics like crafting just feel like nobody had actually played the game. Theres no mass produce button and the progress for crafting is so incredibly slow that even after 50 hours in game with multiple points of me doing nothing but salvaging/scrapping items I only made it to 16/20, not high enough to make the ""iconic"" gear.

Sad truth is, Cyberpunk could have been one of the greatest games of all time, something people put on their top 10s with Ocarina of Time and Final Fantasy. Instead the game is just such a bland and jarringly bad technical experience that the redeeming values it has with an amazing story is better gotten through a youtube playthrough. At this point the best thing you could hope for is a sale or an extensive amount of reworks and patches - though even that seems unlikely.

Don't market the game so aggressively and then fail to deliver.

Don't block gameplay footage and reviews ON said consoles because of it running at sub 30 fps and looking like a nightmare.

You can't do shit in this game, except drive around and shoot bad guys.
Which, normally would be fine, if it hadn't been hyped up to be one of the most immersive, monumental games of our time.
The game is shoddy and unoptimized, nobody looked under the hood before sending this shit out?
The NPC's look and act like zombies; their patterns include walking up and down the street several times.
The wanted system is laughable, you commit a crime (or you just stand there until the cops decide to randomly aggro onto you) and then you must escape the police. However, they can also just spawn right behind you every once in awhile too.
The devs were lazy, and they pushed a product that was falling apart, all for that sweet pre-order payoff.

Don't get me wrong, all of these things considered are awful.
The gameplay itself is not terrible, obviously if it works correctly. 
Running around shooting bad guys is an alright time, the weapons look and feel cool, and quickhacking things is pretty neat.
It's just like a far cry game combined with fallout 4.

"The 8 years spent to develop the game, seems wasted as it lacks innovation, depth and interesting mechanics.  Its a nice looking game, with a mildly interesting story, and an immersive setting, yet they forgot to make a game.  The game pretends to give you choice, as it forces you to do what it wants you to.  The game holds your hand way too much and never lets the player play.  Hacking and stealth mechanics are the worst I have played in a game of this style.  Games from the 90's had better stealth systems.  The A.I is dumb, its no F.E.A.R that's for sure.  Gun play is ok but nothing new.  Crafting is pointless as you pick up better weapons all the time so spending skill points to craft better guns makes no sense.

I feel that the game needs another year to develop the concepts and make the core of the game in depth.

Like a wet mop on a floor or like a super duper exaggerated swallowing SFX? I couldn't tell ya. Other than that, the entire game feels like it's hardly holding itself together. Guns sometimes don't do anything when you fire them, but then the thing you're firing at will still take damage. Character's mouths will move and not say anything.

Most likely, by the time you read this review, chances are the problems will be already fixed.

"If you're looking for a next gen RPG where your choices affect how future events unfold, how characters and factions/groups view and react to you, if you're looking to immerse yourself in a ""living, breathing"" open world which offers interesting locales to visit, activities to take part in, then you should probably look elsewhere, because Cyberpunk 2077 doesn't deliver on any of these aspects (which they advertised). Viewing each of these separately:

Weak RPG mechanics: 
- Game is linear: the only TRUE choice that actually matters is the one you make on the last mission and that's it, the rest don't matter.
- Customization: Stats are attached to clothing, no transmog system. No third person view (even on cut scenes), so what's the point in changing your appearance if we add to this that it's a SINGLE PLAYER game?
- Cyberware was a very interesting concept that never got the attention it deserved, hardly any of them change the way you play or approach missions. 
- Boring attribute and skill system: 3% more damage with handguns?! Wow! thrilling stuff . . .

Bad Open World: 
- Variety of vehicles: You can only drive cars and motorcycles, that's it, add to this mediocre driving mechanics and you have one of the worst transportation methods available.
- NPC AI is laughable: They don't respond to your actions, they don't know how to drive (they use set paths), they say the same two lines over and over, they don't aggro you, the list goes on.
- Police AI is nonexistent.
- NO side activities besides shooting goons and/or driving from point A to point B.
- Map is cluttered with copy pasted content to extend playtime.

Conclusion: I haven't even talked about the bland gameplay, huge amount of bugs and glitches, optimization issues, memory leaks (game runs worse over time) and many other aspects. I really tried to like this game, I played through its entirety, did all side jobs and repeated certain missions to view if any of my choices mattered, hoping to find any redeeming qualities, but alas I never did.

"Where to start with this mess. 

Cyberpunk 2077 is a very good game and setting that was butchered with wrong decisions at every turn. The story, the setting, the characters and the narrative are all top notch. Problem is, the game does not do it's story and setting justice. It starts insanely good story-wise but as you get near the end you feel that this is a very, very rushed game. Game-play wise it is super fun too, playing around with augmentations and iconic weapons feel incredibly satisfying. 

The problem starts with everything else. You have this incredible setting with amazing characters but you do so little with them it just does not make any sense. Your role-playing options are pretty limited (although you don't notice it till the middle of the game because of the characters and incredible voice-acting on everyone's part) and the plot is pretty linear  despite all the interesting possibilities laid out by the setting. What good is an incredible, lore filled and amazing looking setting if you can't interact with it meaningfully? 

Not to mention the bugs and performance issues, I really really wish they were honest with us and delayed this game until it was truly finished without promising all those big lies and not played with customer expectations by promising stuff and delaying all the same. If I judged this game by it's setting, Night City, characters and story alone? This would be one of the best damn games ever made. However as it stands it is only a 7-8 out of 10, which is still fine but nowhere near what it could have been. It truly is sad that the setting Mike Pondsmith has created with love and care was not given the opportunity to reach it's full potential. Shame but what can you do eh?

It's hard to believe they really spent the past 8 years on this. This is not the [i]""next generation of open-world adventure""[/i] we were promised. 

Concluding thoughts and my personal opinion: It's a unique game and I do enjoy it due to the great storyline and art direction. But it has problems, is lacking in so many features, and needs many QoL changes. Is it worth $60? To some, it is. The storyline alone could be worth $60. But for others, probably not. Personally, I'm a big fan of well-written, story-driven games, which this provides.",False
"Fire game tbh. Fun as hell, and it's SO buggy. You're gonna see the exact same bugs over and over. It's straight up broken. Still fun. But buggy. Maybe wait a year if you want the best experience. But, if you wanna take the chance, and you should, then buy it. It's great.",True

"Cyberpunk is a game that went from fame to shame in a Picosecond. It has a few issues but is ultimately weighted out by the successes of the Story, Characters, Dialogue and Stealth gameplay.

All the drama over this game is pretty much restricted to the Console versions. The main issue for me was performance (2080 Super, 32gb RAM, Ryzen 7 3800x) but I was able to run it on Raytracing Medium with 'Cinematic' 30-50 fps and Ultra Non-raytracing at 60+.

Bugs wise, I only had two towards the end of the game that made me have to reload a save, but load times are very low if stored on an M.2. Small cosmetic issues and animation glitches were frequent but not horrific, and due to the patches they do seem to be getting fewer and farther between.

The characters in this world that you can interact with in any meaningful way are some of the best I've seen to date. They're easy to empathise with, have interesting quests to complete with a lot of variation, and are generally the main device for creating a believable world. The world design itself is also very striking and definitely gives you a sense of scale, but honestly most of it is 'dead' space with not much to do unless you want to complete every world event.

Gunplay and Armour is where this game falls apart for me. The gunplay in the beginning is very Spongy, and enemies will take entire magazines to kill. In the mid-game, you get some levels in your character and it becomes less so. Towards the end of the mid-game I found myself two lucky weapon drops that I carried with me to the end of the game, which were able to two-shot basically every enemy, of which there are not many distinct types. I hardly changed my armour at all, since the abundance of medical supplies meant I never really needed to stop the damage with armour, just healing it away by spamming X was more than enough. Combat felt extremely dissatisfying with the exception of stealth combat which is extremely well built out, if a bit frustrating at times.

Body modifications were something I personally hardly touched. I spent no time worrying about upgrading it since what I had from the beginning was honestly enough to finish the campaign and side quests on. This combined with the weapons and armour leads me to believe that this is only an RPG in the sense that there is character choice and dialogue, since character customisation and looting is, again, dissatisfying.

Speaking of, the character choices, dialogue and backgrounds are the best part of this game. The choices I made had a real and lasting impact on gameplay, reputation and ending. There isn't a single piece of dialogue that I wanted to skip, since it all gave you valuable information on the upcoming mission, the world or the characters in it. This in my eyes is the greatest success of the game.

All in all, while I would recommend Cyberpunk 2077, I feel like it's not the game that many were so hyped for. Me? Well, I was optimistic from the start, since CDPR are a fairly legendary studio, but I wasn't overly hyped and as a result I took the game in for what it is, and I did enjoy it. However, if you're looking for strong combat or meaningful loot systems, I'd recommend you try somewhere else. Since modern RPGs all have a loot grind of some description, CP77 must be judged with this in mind and it does lack considerably in my opinion.",True

"If I wanted Fallout 4, I would have bought Fallout 4.",False
"Is it good game with good storyline? Yes. Is it a good rpg? No.

Game was overhyped from the beggining. The world is essentially dead other than main missions. Can do all the gigs and Night city scanner missons which is majority of the game as the main story will take about 15 hours but the rest of the gigs and scanner mission will take you about 40 hours. When game journalists where complaining about this being to long of a game i had hope this would be about 100+ hours for everything to be done but sub 60 is where you would most likely end after doing everything. 
Bug wise its a shit show. So far the hotfixes have fixed most of the broken mission bugs but there is still a heap of bugs. Mostly non game breaking, but jesus its flawed.
Gunplay is good but imo just do a crit build and use comrades hammer. Makes every enemy one shot kill and can shoot through walls 6 feet thick... 

Performance wise, Lmao this game runs worse than shit sliding down the side of a toilet.
My setup r7 2700 and 3060ti on low-med settings averages about 55fps. (rtx off and dlss on perfomance) for a game to run this bad is a joke. Yeah maxed out it looks great but runs worse than a powerpoint slideshow. If you want to run this all maxed out on 1080p you are gonna need a 3070 or higher. Dont listen to what any reviews say about what graphics card you need. They only benchmark in certain areas where the fps is good. In the city the game absolutley tanks into the ground. 

Hopefully CDPR will fix most of the issues like they did with witcher but don't count on this game being solid product for at least 6-12 months from now.

Bugs, glitches, police that litteraly one shot you when you run over pedestrians by mistake (or not) are few of all the problems I encountered.
Cyberpunk looks incredible with ultra graphics but it does not compensate all the flaws/strange physics of the game.
One of the worst things I've experienced is a fixer calling you but not speaking then you get a mission as if CDprojekt forgot to put the dialogue.

"Yes this game has bugs, yes it's not perfect. However.. It's a damn great game with a lot of things to do. The side quests are fun and can get really good and highly recommend doing them! While i have not completed the main story yet the story so far has been amazing and i can't wait to see how this ends. The fact this game is all in first person and yes also in the cutscenes makes this game feel way more emotional during critical moments, you can really get immersed into this world (Except for the bugs that break immersion sometimes) Atleast for me. The gunplay is good to me, the melee combat can be better but it's okay. Remember this is a story driven game, Witcher 3 didn't have the best combat either but it worked for that game! The game has a lot of skills you can unlock which you unlock by leveling up doing side activities, Side quests and main story. Pretty sure if you dive deep into this game you can easily get more than 150 hours into your first playthrough, If you rush the main story it's probably a 20 to 30 hours game for the people that don't like doing side stuff.

Bugs are mostly visual and will be fixed in the next couple months knowing CD projekt red which they did with The Witcher 3 too when that was buggy at launch.

The game runs ok on my rig but it is a very heavy game so be aware of that before you buy it, They will probably optimize the game more in the coming months.

Would love some QoL updates but otherwise it's fine.

As i highly recommend this game i wanna say that if you want to play this game without any bugs it's best to wait until they fixed most of them.

This game gets a 9/10 from me because the story is great and the overall game is just amazing imo. If not for the bugs and some QoL updates it would be a 9.5/10

"Ok. Honest Review of the game. Here goes. 
Short story: Do i like the game and do i wish to play it again? Yes. Anything considered i love the game and will play it again. I took 83 h for my first playthrough to grind and see what the game is about and felt hungry for more in the sense of trying nomad and corporate aside of the first streetkid playthrough and ending. 

Long story: 
Graphics: It is within a month of release a bit buggy and crude even but still i can enjoy the wast environment of night city and what there is to explore. it felt a bit ACM like maybe at the beginning and i've waited for a decent game since Metro Exodus to have that great sense of gameplay and some environment in which you can enjoy the openess and everything. Freeroaming through the big map is alright and all what is happening around you feels great. RTX makes a difference of course but the whole ambience feels like it's there. 

Gameplay: you have choices on how you play. kind of like wolfenstein new order but more high tech. choose your own way to approach situations. i like it when games give you more freedom of choice and sometimes the controls do a bit too much like a slowmo when you don't need it and dodge when you happen to misstap a key but overall you got the situation under control if you want to. a lot of the sidemissions seem similar but then when you do enough of them there's enough difference to make it feel alright. i like the effort that has been put into the background of many of the missions but also i felt like i had wished for the whole city to be a lot more interactive than it was. then the whole game size would have most likely been many times bigger and taken a lot more time to get released. 

Sounds: the game soundtracks are one thing. they happen on specific missions and blend in well then there's also the radio channels you can choose for driving around when you don't want to fasttravel. somehow i came to like the vexelstrom channel. but during 83 h of gameplay maybe they started to sound a bit repetitive but then i just changed channel to get back to what i wanted to hear. overall the stepsounds, ambience and so forth were great. not too much to complain about here. 

Game bugs: the bugs i encountered were mostly object bugs where when you turned around fast you saw a spawn of npc close to you and also when on the move there were a few funny traffic issues with cars flying across an intersection or objects going poltergeistish. i didn't have any save bugs or difficulties playing the game. a couple things i missed were minimap zoom out at faster speeds, tracking for the cyberpsychosis missions and some other minor things. a bit gtaish with the npcs but still the voices for collisions and interactions were pretty funny. but many times the npcs felt pretty cold. maybe a bit more to choose from on jig jig street would have made up for this? :P

Longivity: the game still has a lot to come. couple dlcs and multiplayer but as from release i can see myself playing the other two backgrounds and variations after the first playthrough until more content. i liked the ending and i saw there are multiple ones so the game is not a one off but rather something that is replayable and has more paths to unlock. as for how those alternative paths go i don't know yet but even in the one playthrough there were multiple options and even if the other ones are somehow a fairly linear path with the first i think the street cred vs nomad vs corporate will make a mix of the story and the endings you choose may make the gaming experience different. and when you get into a game as much for the story and dedication then you get hungry for more. 

I recommend the game for those who like mass effect, gta, deus ex hr, metro kind of games and want to have more to explore and are a fan of cyberpunk. i liked it and can't wait to see what more it has to offer. enjoyed the first playthrough. Thanks for reading.",True

The state of this game as it is, is the real Soulkiller. Many minor flaws can be changed through free dlc, but it will be built upon a rotten foundation that cannot be fixed.

While this game is certainly a buggy, seldom unplayable mess, its storytelling in pretty much every story mission, side quest, and meaningless ""side gig"" is always compelling.

While the AI may not be terribly smart, and rather two dimensional (they don't have daily routines, they made that part up. Or cut it from the game), the abundance of story rich missions and quests definitely makes the world feel kinda real.

It needs a lot of work, CD. But not bad... You made a game that consistently draws me back just to see what stories it can share.

The game was fun, kind of short. Had me glued to the computer for a couple of days, and once I beat the game I was kinda like 'well, is that all'? Seems like that once you beat the main quests, and all of the side quests then there is nothing really left to do. Kind of wish they would add some more content.
Ran into a couple of glitches, nothing serious. There were times where I would hear the creepy cyberpsycho breathing far after I killed him, so had to save and reload. Also I would see a weapon on the screen (like if I were to pick it up) stuck on the screen until I saved and reloaded. 
Played the game on low-settings because my gaming rig isn't all that great, so there were a couple of low fps moments.

*insert comment on the time since announcement here*

How far games have come (visually at least) in the past 10 years is incredible, And BY GOD does this game do it right.

I recently snagged a 3090 (no 3080s anywhere) and am still rocking a 3600x, but this game is totally playable on ultra 1440p, 50-60 fps, and I would think Im cpu bound because it only drops in highly populated areas. Just updated to the new nvidia day 1 drivers too, so that may also help.

4.5 hours currently and still at 1% completion, at least i assume that is what is shown in the inventory.

Gameplay seems relatively engaging, but i think it will need time to see if it will stay fresh, no real complaints so far tho.

And literally the most amazing thing, was the minimal amount of bugs.

The only real thing I had to do was change my audio output from 32bit  192000hz to 32bit 44100hz to stop the audio crackling.

And other than that and a few visual bugs, police cars in the cutscene wigging out, hand animations when swapping guns, and npcs heads wigging out randomly, nothing gamebreaking.

Tho i did at one point have my sprint get locked and a few inputs stop working for a few seconds, but pressing alt fired my gun and then i guess it was fine?

But so far a must play, especially to see the real power of raytracing, the game is absolutely stunning.

EDIT: FFS WHY DO GAMES ALWAYS USE BORDERLESS WINDOWED BY DEFAULT

gained like 20 fps at least indoors currently, unfortunately the game is now crashing on every other load. :(((

Sad thing is that that's about where the game ended for me. The city is beautiful, huge, well designed. But it lacks life, variety. there's just nothing to do after finishing missions.
There's a lot more to say but others have said it numerous times.

At times like these I wish steam had 5 star rating system instead of just Yes or No in regards to recommendation, in this case I am forced to choose No. But I will come back to this review in the future (depending on how much the game will change.)

"So here is my review after all of this time.

There are TON LOADS of graphical bug , other kinda bug , etc and etc
but the story , the game play , everything is awsome. the story is great. im in 20 Hours now and i havent got so far but its been amazing. 
night city have lot to offer you , side quest stuff to read, Cool GUNS. 
perks and stuff , the level up is a bit slow. the third view sometimes hit the perfomance so i stick to drive in FPS mode , and again lots of graphical GLITCHES. be sure to update to latest nvidia driver. if u really want to enjoy this game give it a month or two , wait for updates and patches , this WILL be GOTY.

see u in night city. \o/

EDIT: Finished the game. damn what a story. my ending might be kinda sad , but i guess it was the best choice.",True
"Here's the headline: If you enjoy Far Cry, Tomb Raider, Mass Effect, etc don't let the negative press or unrealistic expectations scare you away from one of the best in the genre.

I'm about 40 hours in and this game has got so much negative press I just wanted to stop by and say this is really [b]one of the best games I've ever played[/b]. I can't say I've encountered any bugs and the game did crash once after a fast travel load but recovered from an autosave. The reason I've enjoyed this game so much is because 1) the expansive city and surrounding area. I've played a lot of MMOs, Far Cry, Tomb Raider, etc and you're always aware of the boundaries. I think this game succeeds pretty well in giving you an unbounded sense to the world because its so expansive and detailed. 2) One of my favorite parts of the game is when other characters are driving and we're in the car together just shooting the breeze, talking, and I'm free to look out the window. I know it sounds strange but its a nice balance to all the action and the landscapes and cityscapes are just a joy to observe. 3) You can choose whatever playstyle suits you or quickly switch between them. This game does a good job allowing you to play however you like in different situations (stealth, sniper, machine guns, rifles, swords, knives, hands) without necessarily needing to be maxed out in that spec. 

Don't let the haters scare you off. Money well spent.",True
